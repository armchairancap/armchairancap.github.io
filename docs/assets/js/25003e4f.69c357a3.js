By the time I started disliking it and [recognized](/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks) the problem it was too late.\\n\\nThe Foundation has been far from helpful, but xx coin holders made decisions along the way, so I don\'t know what the Foundation could have done even if its members were competent. The community has displayed nothing but utter incompetence and the Foundation helped them turn some of it into reality.\\n\\nThe Council was similar: no role or power to do anything but \\"guide\\", but also no conviction to raise alarms and stop the community from running the project into the ground.\\n\\nThe *jeet* lundatics have been fully in chartge of running the asylum.\\n\\nThose aren\'t the only problems, but they are key problems.\\n\\n## Where are the xx whales?\\n\\nI don\'t know. It seems Roger Ver may be one, but he\'s been occupied lately.\\n\\nIf the rest of the whales had any sense, they would have ganged up and taken over because DAO votes always gather just a small fraction of all votes. \\n\\nEven after 5 years of validating I\'ve never learned of any whale I\'ve never spoken to one and, even as I\'ve tried to advocate certain improvements during 2023 and 2024, not one ever reached out to me.\\n\\nFrom that I conclude they either don\'t bother to keep an eye on the project because the coin dropped a lot soon after it launchyed or they had ideas different from mine. (I suspect it\'s not the latter because I\'ve never seen anything sensible apart from Richard\'s development bounties and hackathons.)\\n\\nFor example, I wanted to stop large centralized pools, implement improvements to the on-chain identity module and focus on [postage](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#postage) feature development. The first was rejected, the second too, and the third for some reason never got out of a discussion on draft implementation (see xx Network forum for more, although I\'ve blogged on some of those issues here).\\n\\nThe *jeets* in the community wanted stupid marketing campaigns, more CEX listings and similar nonsense (including paying for \\"market makers\\"!). \\nThe Foundation didn\'t go ahead with the worst parts of it (maybe some of it was simply due to the lack of funds rather than the desire to do the right thing), but enough time and money has been wasted on nonsense community proposals and at the same time the Foundation wouldn\'t do anyhthing but rubber-stamp what they could.\\n\\nWith that setup and workflow what happens in the long term is the community harms the project. The Foundation may stop or delay funding for some very bad or expensive ideas here and there, but in the long term the outcome is the same.\\n\\n:::note\\nI\'d like to thank Richard and Keith for help and guidance over the years. \\n\\nThe Foundation has done a lousy job.\\n\\nWe would have been much better off if Richard was in charge of the project as its benevolent dictator. \\n:::\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nThere are no next steps, really.\\n\\n:::warning\\nI\'ve powered off and deleted all nodes. I will disable wallets and stop nominating as well.\\n\\nI may move Haven documentation to a sub-section of this site, which will probably break some links. \\n\\nSorry in advance for any inconvenience. \\n:::\\n\\nI didn\'t become a validator because I needed the income (I\'ve only ever sunk resources into this project), but because I wanted to participate in the community.\\n\\nLikewise, I didn\'t quit because I got rich validating, but because participating hasn\'t work for me for years. You fix one window, the NPCs break two.\\n\\nI hope some smart whales take over \\"democracy\\" and the DAO and turn things around so I\'ll keep an eye on xx Network on X. I\'m skeptical about the chances of that happening because I\'ve been unable to see any signs of a smart whale in the community.\\n\\nOther than that, I don\'t plan to continue actively participating in the xx Network community."},{"id":"2025/04/01/supra-starkey-multiple-addresses","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/04/01/supra-starkey-multiple-addresses","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-01-supra-starkey-multiple-addresses.md","title":"Multiple addresses in Supra StarKey wallet","description":"Basic tips for using multiple wallets and addresses in Supra Starkey","date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"}],"readingTime":5.45,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/04/01/supra-starkey-multiple-addresses","title":"Multiple addresses in Supra StarKey wallet","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["supra"],"description":"Basic tips for using multiple wallets and addresses in Supra Starkey","keywords":["supra","starkey","sns","name"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-04-01-supra-starkey-multiple-addresses_01.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Taking a break from xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/12/stopped-validating-on-xx-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"Supra signature validation without the SDK","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/30/supra-signature-validation"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [Use multiple addresses](#use-multiple-addresses)\\n- [Use multiple wallets](#use-multiple-wallets)\\n- [How could a wallet be exposed and not all its addresses get drained?](#how-could-a-wallet-be-exposed-and-not-all-its-addresses-get-drained)\\n- [Wallet setup](#wallet-setup)\\n- [Add addresses to same StarKey wallet](#add-addresses-to-same-starkey-wallet)\\n  - [Imported accounts](#imported-accounts)\\n- [Basic privacy protection](#basic-privacy-protection)\\n  - [Method one](#method-one)\\n  - [Method two](#method-two)\\n  - [Method three](#method-three)\\n- [Take-away](#take-away)\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nSupra Name Service (SNS) is one of my favorite features on the Supra Network.\\n\\nThis post shares some tips related to using multiple wallets and addresses, as well as SNS, in StarKey wallet.\\n\\n## Use multiple addresses\\n\\nWhy? Because wallets can get drained.\\n\\nSecondly, although Supra isn\'t a privacy-focused network, multiple addreses can be better for your privacy as well.\\n\\n## Use multiple wallets\\n\\nShould you use multiple wallets? \\n\\nMaybe yes. If your wallet password gets compromised, all addresses in it are at risk.\\n\\n## How could a wallet be exposed and not all its addresses get drained?\\n\\nI\'ve mentioned wallets and addresses can get drained, but how could just one address in a wallet get drained?\\n\\nBecause when you connect to a dApp, you pick *an* address - not all addresses - from your wallet. \\n\\nIf malware that auto-approves transactions takes over, it may approve transactions, but may not necessarily go through the entire list of addresses, connect and drain them all.\\n\\nIf malware is any good, it\'ll drain all addresses, but if not, some may survive.\\n\\n## Wallet setup\\n\\nGiven the above, you can consider your risks and convenience. \\n\\nI like a setup like this: two wallets, several addresses.\\n\\n| Wallet   | Address     | Purpose  |  SNS |\\n|:---------|----------|----------|------|\\n| 1| Treasury | Staking  | (none) |\\n| 1| LP       | LP-ing   | (none) |\\n| 2| Play     | Trusted dApps    | `myname.supra` |\\n| 2| Testing  | Testing untrusted dApps | `test.myname.supra` |\\n\\nI wouldn\'t even give SNS names to addresses (accounts) in wallet One. \\n\\nFor wallet Two, I think it\'s nice to have a name at least for \\"frquent use\\" address. You could have two names (one or both subdomains) or two unrelated names (e.g. `play.supra`, `test.supra`), but sending tokens between them would identify them as likely owned by the same user in any case.\\n\\n:::tip\\nAs the first wallet (Treasury/LP) is most valuable, it\'s best to not even use it on the same device where your wallet Two is used.\\n\\nFurthermore, you may want to buy a Ledger hardware wallet for that wallet. Wallet number two may not be valuable enough to warrant protection (especially if the lack of convenience bothers you).\\n:::\\n\\n## Add addresses to same StarKey wallet\\n\\nThis step is not very obvious, but it\'s simple enough. Click on the round cricle in top left corner.\\n\\n![Add additional addresses](/img/blog/2025-04-01-supra-starkey-multiple-addresses_01.png)\\n\\nThe next step requires some thinking. \\n\\nLet\'s say I\'ve created my wallet 2 and in it I already have my \\"Play\\" address. I want another one for Testing.\\n\\n![Select addresses type](/img/blog/2025-04-01-supra-starkey-multiple-addresses_02.png)\\n\\nIn order of my personal preference:\\n\\n1) Sub-account \\"Testing\\" will be recoverable with the same recovery method - it\'s a \\"cousin\\" of your Play account\\n\\n2) New account - different recovery, but approximately same risks, so I don\'t like this approach\\n\\n3) Imported account - this is the least convenient method, as you need to create an account (address) elsewhere and get its private key. \\n\\n### Imported accounts\\n\\nThese seem like a hassle, but they have some advantages as well. \\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n\\n- Just getting a private key out of a wallet and sending/copying it around is risky and may result in a compromised address (not wallet)\\n- You need to protect that private key ... somehow, because StarKey can\'t recover it for you. So you\'ll also need to keep it encrypted (or printed on paper) somewhere\\n\\nAdvantages:\\n\\n- This method allows you to create and use \\"vanity address\\", such as `0xb00b5...` (i.e. \\"boobs\\"). In fact, you can create and import several such addresses, and it\'s easy to find them and recognize them in SupraScan even without a name\\n- If you intend to use the same address from the CLI or similar, you\'ll need to have a copy of your private key elsewhere anyway\\n\\nMy use cases for imported accounts are related to both of the items listed under advantages (you can read about it [in a recent post here](/blog/2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names)).\\n\\n## Basic privacy protection\\n\\nThis is actually one of the main reasons for this post: as I\'ve mentioned Supra transacations are pseudo-anonymous, but let\'s do what we can.\\n\\nThat is, make at least one hop between wallets One and Two, so that the link between wallet Two and One is not obvious.\\n\\n### Method one\\n\\n:::warning\\n- Some CEX reuse addresses, so doing this multiple times doesn\'t work well privacy-wise\\n- It is recommended to deposit and withdraw different amounts\\n- Don\'t withdraw from the same CEX to both wallet One and Two\\n:::\\n\\n1) Send Supra from wallet One to a CEX\\n\\n2) Withdraw (different amount) funds from CEX to wallet Two\\n\\n### Method two\\n\\nSend ERC20 USDC (Ethereum) from a CEX to Metamask.\\n\\nFrom there, send USDC to Dexlyn bridge to get dexUSDC, then use Dexlyn Swap to swap dexUSDC to Supra using an address in wallet Two.\\n\\nLike in Method One, you may want to swap from dexUSDC to Supra in random-sized chunks over a period spanning at least several days.\\n\\n### Method three\\n\\nYou could also buy Supra on a CEX and send to wallet Two, as presumably you\'ll never need a lot of Supra for addresses in wallet Two.\\n\\nBut - see Method number One - if you do it multiple times **or** send from CEX to both wallet One and Two, it\'s downhill from there.\\n\\n--\\n\\nNo method gives you Monero-like privacy (far from that!), but that\'s okay: our sole purpose is to not make it obvious to scammers that you also own wallet One.\\n\\nFurthermore, if your wallet One is better secured (e.g. separate device, Ledger, multi-sig), it\'s even not that critical.\\n\\nIn any case, sooner or later you\'ll make a mistake and send from wallet One to wallet Two or vice versa, so don\'t sweat it - just secure wallet One and you\'ll be fine.\\n\\n## Take-away\\n\\nMultiple wallets are useful for obvious reasons. High-value wallets should not be installed on the same device as low-value, frequent-use wallets.\\n\\nIt\'s also advisable to use multiple accounts within each. I prefer to use sub-accounts, but other approaches may work for certain use cases. \\n\\nFor \\"frequent use\\" wallets SupraNS names are convenient and any approach (domains, subdomains, etc) is fine for most users."},{"id":"2025/03/30/supra-signature-validation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/30/supra-signature-validation","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-30-supra-signature-validation-python.md","title":"Supra signature validation without the SDK","description":"Validate stuff signed by private key of a Supra wallet","date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"}],"readingTime":5.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/03/30/supra-signature-validation","title":"Supra signature validation without the SDK","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["supra"],"description":"Validate stuff signed by private key of a Supra wallet","keywords":["supra","starkey","cli","ed25519","signature","validate"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-03-30-supra-signature-validation-python.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Multiple addresses in Supra StarKey wallet","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/01/supra-starkey-multiple-addresses"},"nextItem":{"title":"About some special SupraNS (SNS) names","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/29/special-supra-suprans-names"}},"content":"- [Intro](#intro)\\n- [Supra CLI](#supra-cli)\\n- [Cryptography](#cryptography)\\n- [Sign and validate](#sign-and-validate)\\n- [Take-aways and next steps](#take-aways-and-next-steps)\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nHow to sign and validate a message using your wallet private key from the CLI?\\n\\nI blogged about this topic in the context of xx Network and I need this for Supra Network as well.\\n\\n## Supra CLI\\n\\nI haven\'t spent much time playing with Supra CLI, but recently I got my hands on the Docker image v8.0.2 (which is currently the main way Supra distributes the CLI package).\\n\\nYou can read about getting started in the CLI section of the [Supra Documentation](https://docs.supra.com/). You download the Docker container and create a profile, which stores your settings similar to below (line breaks added for easier viewing).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ supra profile -l \\nEnter your password: \\n-------------------------- Profile List ---------------------------------\\n\\t(*) deftest\\nCliProfile { account_address: \\"0xf63b51af98a1ff6b469bb5b8e9fa4b81733b2ef79234c4bffd949bf53f6579dc\\", \\n            ed25519_public_key: 02d0b5b6226d8b9606aedac673de9591f34745f1e38d2f3805067dba2ed5b1a5, \\n            rpc_url: \\"https://rpc-testnet.supra.com/\\", \\n            faucet_url: \\"https://rpc-testnet.supra.com/\\", \\n            chain_id: 6 }\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```\\n\\nThe above is my default profile for testnet. Where\'s the private key? You need `-l -r` to include the private key as well.\\n\\n## Cryptography\\n\\nThis is not my area, but we have search engines (and more recently, AIs). \\n\\nTo get started, I referenced `[1]`:\\n\\n![Raw signatures](/img/blog/2025-03-30-supra-signature-validation-python.png)\\n\\nWhat we can see here is raw keys, which - as we shall see later - is the same thing that Supra CLI shows us. This hopefully means we can use the same tools to get the same result.\\n\\nI then proceeded with [RTFM](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ed25519/) to get it done.\\n\\nReference: `[1] https://asecuritysite.com/openssh/openssh2`\\n\\n## Sign and validate\\n\\nSo, how to sign stuff? (\\"Stuff\\" means stuff - anything that can be fed via STDIN or referenced as a file).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ supra profile sign --profile deftest --stdin reputable.supra\\nEnter your password: \\nContentSignature { signature: \\"c36472c483adbc6d311234984debd9947fbf25d36539183fe4a100da335f7839fa3cb3c276a82a025b5a1464a459aeacec5383a7c6dffa387fce08a7b0e1c203\\" }\\n```\\n\\nIf I had an image such as img.png, I\'d do `--file ./img.png`. \\n\\nNote that if a profile has multiple addresses, I\'d also provide the account address. \\n\\n```sh\\n$ supra profile sign -h\\nSign the payload\\n\\nUsage: supra profile sign [OPTIONS]\\n\\nOptions:\\n      --profile <PROFILE>                        Profile to use from the CLI config\\n      --private-key-file <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>      Signing Ed25519 private key file path\\n      --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>                Signing Ed25519 private key\\n      --account-address <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>        \\n      --rpc-url <RPC_URL>                        \\n      --faucet-url <FAUCET_URL>                  \\n      --sender-account <SENDER_ACCOUNT>          Sender account address\\n      --file <FILE>                              \\n      --stdin <STDIN>                            \\n      --expected-signature <EXPECTED_SIGNATURE>  \\n  -h, --help                                     Print help (see more with \'--help\')\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn any case, a signature is generated by signing stuff with the Ed25519 private key (in Supra CLI profile, it\'s named `ed25519_secret_key`) that belongs to the profile and address you provided. \\n\\nNow the fun part: there\'s just `supra profile sign`, but no `supra profile validate`. Oops!\\n\\n```sh\\n$ supra profile -h\\nManage Supra CLI profile\\n\\nUsage: supra profile <COMMAND>\\n\\nCommands:\\n  list, -l, --list             List public keys of all profiles.\\n  activate                     Activate the profile.\\n  new                          Creates a new profile.\\n  generate-validator-identity  Generate validator identity file.\\n  remove                       Remove existing cli profile\\n  modify                       Modify the profile attributes\\n  sign                         Sign the payload\\n  help                         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\\n```\\n\\nI suppose this is when they tell you \\"just use the SDK\\". Yeah, no, thank you.\\n\\nI don\'t mean that it wouldn\'t work, but rather that then I\'d have to use the SDK which is precisely what I don\'t want.\\n\\nI want something lightweight that works in Python. And there\'s no officially supported Supra SDK for Python (there\'s this [fork](https://github.com/Entropy-Foundation/aptos-python-sdk), but it\'s not supported and who knows if it even works. I haven\'t checked whether it contains signature validation functions).\\n\\nSo, it\'s back to that RTFM link above (\\"generic\\" Python Cryptography module). Using that approach, you can create a script that uses your private keyh to sign stuff in Python. \\n\\nYou can make it so that you provide a private Ed25519 key and string to sign, sign and then validate.\\n\\n```sh\\nPRIVKEY=\\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\"\\n$ ./sign_message.py ${PRIVKEY} reputable.supra\\n\\nSignature:\\nf506d305fb4026d9822b09a547c30443f299a14a583e4b95b05466fe60d7d59b6dc7f2b7612fcb0afd19ec285ec246e59556c5590655938ad105b402fd3ab400\\n\\nSignature is valid.\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s great, right? Not really.\\n\\nI got a *different* signature using the same inputs that I used with Supra CLI!\\n\\n```raw\\n# f506d305fb4026d9822b09a547c30443f299a14a583e4b95b05466fe60d7d59b6dc7f2b7612fcb0afd19ec285ec246e59556c5590655938ad105b402fd3ab400 # Python \\n# c36472c483adbc6d311234984debd9947fbf25d36539183fe4a100da335f7839fa3cb3c276a82a025b5a1464a459aeacec5383a7c6dffa387fce08a7b0e1c203 # Supra CLI\\n```\\n\\nAnd, even worse, if I validate the Supra CLI signature using my Python script, it fails.\\n\\nThat means we didn\'t sign it exactly the same way.\\n\\nIf I sign and validate signature (\\"end to end\\") in Python, it works. But I can\'t validate Supra CLI signatures using the right public key. \\n\\n:::note\\nI spotted [this](https://github.com/Entropy-Foundation/aptos-python-sdk/blob/ed7d1136caaf83a06e0566a2eec08cf1a6ce7f9a/aptos_sdk/secp256k1_ecdsa.py#L55) part which hints at deterministic signatures, but I didn\'t get anywhere with that lead.\\n:::\\n\\nHow it possible to get different result? Very easily. The Supra documentation doesn\'t have those details yet, so to start, one would have to read [this](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/cryptography#digital-signature-verification) and check if that\'s how it works on Supra... \\n\\n## Take-aways and next steps\\n\\nSupra CLI lets me sign, but not validate.\\n\\nPython Cryptography module lets me do both, but I can only validate what I signed with Python, and not what Supra CLI signed.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe Python Cryptography approach isn\'t completely useless: if I sign and validate using it, it does work.\\n\\nThe reason to not like it is getting a private key out of your wallet (or CLI profile) is risky (and annoying). It can be fine in some isolated batch-processing environment where all keys are stored in a database, but it\'s not a good idea for regular use and it\'s completely impractical for StarKey use.\\n\\nMy use case happens to be batch processing, but not of the kind that can work: my input is a Supra CLI-signed signature which means I can\'t validate it with my Python approach (unless I find a way to fix it).\\n\\nAnother shortcoming - which may or may not bother you - is that the Python approach doesn\'t give you the wallet address. If you scroll up to see Supra CLI profile list output, you\'ll see that `account_address` is different from `ed25519_public_key`. \\n\\nEven if you perform end-to-end signing and validation in Python, you won\'t know the wallet address without additional steps or more information provided by the user. If you need to transfer coins or do something else, you\'ll need additional steps to compute account address from `ed25519_public_key` (doesn\'t look hard, e.g. see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76946957/aptos-get-address-from-privatekey), but has to be done if you need it and it\'d better generate the address that\'s in wallet, in terms of derivation path).

Maybe one day they\'ll expire on their own.\\n:::\\n\\nWhat follows is my Q&A on how I plan to use and wortk with \\"special\\" SNS names.\\n\\n## Is there a list of \\"special\\" SupraNS names I own?\\n\\nNot yet.\\n\\nThe \\"special\\" SNS names I own currently aren\'t listed on the [SupraNS](https://suprans.name) site where my SupraNS names are available for sale. \\n\\nThe reason is I don\'t want to make them available to random buyers. I would like to make them available to users who should own them.\\n\\n## How can one find those \\"special\\" SNS names?\\n\\nIf you\'ve asked yourself that question or if the question above makes sense to you, then you realize there\'s a discoverability problem. Congratulation!\\n\\nYou can look up a name at [https://suprans.id/names](https://suprans.id/names) and if you notice the wallet address that owns the name is the same one that SupraNS mentions, then I have it. Next, go to SupranS.name and search for it. If it\'s listed as \\"special\\" or not listed at all it\'s \\"special\\".\\n\\nIf you run a project or business that uses one of the \\"special\\" SNS names I own, **reach out to me on X**.\\n\\nI can transfer them for a small fee that covers my cost of labor.\\n\\n## What happens if no one steps forward by the time such-and-such name expires?\\n\\nI can let that SNS expire in which case the project or business that wants it has to race against others who may want to acquire that same name for resale or own use.\\n\\nThat approach seems bad, so I plan to auction such names starting in late 2025 or early 2026 (i.e. 2-3 months before they expire).\\n\\n## How is auctioning them better than letting them expire?\\n\\nAs explained above, letting them expire doesn\'t mean the \\"right\\" user (if that can be determined at all!) would succeed to get that name.\\n\\nIt\'s equally likely that a competitor or squatter gets the name. If three people compete for registering the domain, each person\'s odds are 1/3.\\n\\nThe second problem is discoverability/visibility mentioned earlier. How does a person even learn of Supra to begin with?\\n\\nSomeone who realizes a \\"special\\" SNS name they want is registered today should be be relieved to find that it is not available for sale in open market and - assuming they represent a business that makes use of such name - they could easily get it right away.\\n\\nBut, it is almost certain that many users who\'ll one day want that \\"special\\" SNS name won\'t even learn of SupraNS before my special SNS names expire in March 2026.\\n\\nIf these special names aren\'t on the market (as they aren\'t on SupraNS.name now), they have no visibiliy. It\'s hard to discover them and that makes it less likely that those who may want them will become aware of them in 2025. Because of that:\\n\\n- If they reach out in 2025, they\'ll get them affordably and easily (as long as they represent a business or project that ought to own the SNS)\\n- If they by some chance don\'t pay attention in 2025, they would probably appreciate to learn in early 2026 that the name they may want appeared at some auction marketplace and get a chance to buy them at the price they can afford\\n\\nIn order to get a second chance and gain visibility before they expire, these special names *should* hit the market.\\n\\nThe worst case: a name expires and gets squatted by a \\"hard-ass squatter\\" who wants US$20,000 for it or - even worse - an impostor, scammer or competitor. \\n\\nThe \\"best\\" case: a name expires and no one wants to use it, so you get a chance to register it in days or weeks after that. If your \\"special\\" SNS name is not worth the Dexlyn SNS registration fee, that might work.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nMany SupraNS brands have been squatted and some may be squatted by scammers or competing businesses. \\n\\nI don\'t know if Dexlyn plan to implement \\"conflict resolution\\" procedures available for Internet DNS TLDs.\\n\\nI think my two-phase approach is ethical, fair, effective, and works well."},{"id":"2025/03/26/move-supra-to-dex","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/26/move-supra-to-dex","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-26-move-supra-to-dex.md","title":"Supra holders, move active stashes to a DEX","description":"Why I\'ve been moving active stash to DEXes","date":"2025-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"},{"label":"economics","permalink":"/blog/tags/economics"}],"readingTime":28.28,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/03/26/move-supra-to-dex","title":"Supra holders, move active stashes to a DEX","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["supra","economics"],"description":"Why I\'ve been moving active stash to DEXes","keywords":["supra","dex","economics"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-03-26_04_dex_lev_03.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"About some special SupraNS (SNS) names","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/29/special-supra-suprans-names"},"nextItem":{"title":"SupraNS (SNS) names with hexadecimal symbols","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names"}},"content":"- [Intro](#intro)\\n- [Current Supra-listing CEXes](#current-supra-listing-cexes)\\n  - [Governance](#governance)\\n  - [Market M-ing](#market-m-ing)\\n  - [Spot](#spot)\\n  - [Perpetual Futures aka Perps](#perpetual-futures-aka-perps)\\n- [DEXes](#dexes)\\n  - [DEX benefits to you and Supra ecosystem](#dex-benefits-to-you-and-supra-ecosystem)\\n  - [Slippage and fees](#slippage-and-fees)\\n  - [Dexlyn](#dexlyn)\\n  - [Atmos](#atmos)\\n  - [Solido](#solido)\\n  - [What else is coming](#what-else-is-coming)\\n- [Cost comparison](#cost-comparison)\\n  - [Anecdotal example](#anecdotal-example)\\n- [Take-aways and call to action](#take-aways-and-call-to-action)\\n\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nSome people who advocate DEXes are decentralization fanatics, others are conspiracy theorists, and some \\"all of the above\\".\\n\\nThere are also pragmatists in this group. In this post I share my pragmatic arguments in favor of moving your active stash to a DEX. \\n\\nNote that this is specific to Supra and my own purpose, which is to see the project grow and, with it, the value it provides to its ecosystem. More value means more growth and a higher coin price. I view Supra as my \\"enterprise\\" blockchain holding: I\'d like it to see grow as a normal for-profit business would.\\n\\n:::note\\nI elaborate because I also hold xx coin which is more of a \\"cause coin\\" for me and where I\'m not pragmatic in terms of the token *price*, earnings and such.\\n\\nIn the case of xx coin, I\'m interested in \\"economically-sustainable private messaging\\" and have very different concerns.\\n:::\\n\\nIn the case of Supra, I don\'t think centralization is bad. I simply don\'t like how *these particular unregulated guys* run their business.\\n\\nAnother special circumstance is Supra is a good L1 platform for DEX markets, so I also have - all Supra holders and stakers *should have* - a conflict of interest in their mind.\\n\\n## Current Supra-listing CEXes\\n\\nI don\'t expect to add anything new here, as cryptocurrency DEXes have been around for a decade or more, and pragmatic arguments against CEXes have been around longer.\\n\\nBriefly, from the viewpoint explained above (meaning: pragmatic, Supra-specific arguments from an enterprise POV), this is what\'s wrong with CEXes (especially the unregulated ones):\\n\\n- Lack of transparency: this is really the worst part\\n- Poor business practices: we don\'t know who and how (why, because no transparency) not only in terms of transparency, but also in terms of governance\\n- Leverage (Futures): this isn\'t bad in itself (it also exists on regulated CEXes, and on DEXes), but I think it\'s a major tool used in market manipulation because it\'s likely used *against retail users* on unregulated CEXes\\n\\nRegarding the lack of transparency, folks on X like to make fun of crypto/DeFi fans saying cypherpunks, who claimed zero regulation was good, start whining when their altcoin gets smashed on the same markets. I agree with them:\\n\\n- I may decide to participate in a zero-regulation market (a DEX, for example) and I won\'t whine if lose\\n- Zero-regulation (or \\"extremely lax\\" regulation) CEX could work if these exchanges voluntarily shared data that should be shared. But they don\'t share anything of substance, while regulated CEXes probably collect and share too much, which increases costs for no benefit to users. There\'s nothing \\"in-between\\" which is a shame\\n\\n:::info\\nCEXes also have some good sides and advantages. For example, most of these are still true:\\n- Low latency, very suitable for *frequent* trading \\n- Better features for advanced traders (such as leverage, automation, APIs, clients) \\n- Convenience (in some cases)\\n\\nCEXes still command close to 80% of crypto spot trading and there\'s nothing wrong with using them. People say \\"not your private keys not your coins\\", but I would guess more people lost their coins in self-custody than at CEXes.\\n:::\\n\\nNow I\'ll give some anecdotal examples of how unregulated CEXes suck.\\n\\n### Governance\\n\\nTransparency is sometimes legally mandated, but for unregulated exchanges it\'s merely a choice. \\n\\nThere\'s nothing that prevents them from busting manipulators, reporting money launderes, and such. From what I can tell the unregulated CEXes where Supra is listed are doing the bare minimum. \\n\\nAnother area of governance is operations. If you work for a regulated FSI player you\'re simply *not allowed* to do certain things the weird or wrong way. There are checks and checks of checks.\\n\\nFor example, using plain text passwords could be grounds for dismissal, and you\'ll get discovered because in the regulated world Operations are not in charge of Security - there\'s a Security team who audits and checks Operations. But the ByBit guy transferred $1.5B to the North Korean hackers because ByBit used a DIY workflow \\"invented\\" by ByBit where security practices failed. Had they followed established practices in place in the UK or US, they\'d work slower, safer and more expensively. They probably didn\'t like the speed and cost of the more \\"regulated\\" approach and thought they were smarter... Fortunately ByBit - and with it its Supra users - survived (for now).\\n\\nThis argument applies to DEXes as well (were bugs may go undetected due to corner cutting in development, operations or auditing), but it\'s not an argument against *regulated* CEXes. \\n\\nUnfortunately, no Western (regulated) CEX list Supra at this time, so there\'s no \\"better\\" CEX we can go to.\\n\\n### Market M-ing\\n\\nOne example of poor transparency is market making (or manipulating...  - with unregulated CEXes you can\'t even know which it is).\\n\\nConsider this screenshot of trades in SUPRA/USDT (Spot) taken yesterday.\\n\\n![Market M-ing at a CEX yesterday](/img/blog/2025-03-26_02_dex_mm.png)\\n\\nThis is *not* normal. A market **maker** would create buy and sell orders and let others **take** them. \\n\\nBut we can see here both buys and sells are happening and only of these particular orders:\\n- Are there no other buyers/sellers whose order would be in this list?\\n- Why would anyone who\'s a *maker* buy *and* sell within seconds like that? A *taker* would, but a *maker* would not.\\n\\nThis looks like market manipulation more than market making to me. \\n\\nAt times, the MM guys go on a day trip or take a day off, and then you see the extent of it:\\n\\n![Market M-ing at a CEX yesterday](/img/blog/2025-03-26_03_dex_mm_mia.png)\\n\\nI checked the smaller pair on this exchange, SUPRA/USDC, and it\'s even worse there. (There the making/manipulation is probably ran by some USDC-outsourced marketing guys who are supposed to aid USDC adoption.)\\n\\nAgain, the problem here isn\'t that there\'s a market \\"maker\\". The problem is that they\'re a \\"taker\\". They *actively trade*.\\n\\nIf you make a market, you create buy/sell orders that others \\"take\\"\\" (by issuing matching sell/buy orders). If there\'s no genuine activity, market maker\'s orders just sit there for the time when a user comes, to have liquidity to sell or buy into. Market makers aren\'t supposed to impact the price.\\n\\nSeeing a lot more volume when they\'re not day-tripping means when they\'re gone there\'s no trading. Obviously, this means bots are rampant. These MM guys engage in wash trading (to create appearance of activity) and various forms of market manipulation all deemed illegal in regulated markets.\\n\\nAnd, related to transparency, you don\'t even know who\'s MM-ing, who\'s paying them, and if they\'re actively trading against exchange\'s retail users. But, you\'d probably be right if you assumed the worst (such as, that these deregulated CEXes don\'t care what kind of MM-ing - making or manipulation - goes on).\\n\\n:::info\\nBinance recently [busted](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/detail/4a5fa79a6c174db29c43122db732af1e) a crooked MM and confiscated their funds. \\n\\nI\'ve never heard of anything like tha thappening at any of the exchanges that list Supra and I assume \\"reasonably crooked\\" MMers operate even on well-run unregulated exchanges.\\n:::\\n\\nSome \\"crypto people\\" told me I\'m nit-picking, and \\"it\'s all MM\\". *That is nonsense*. If you *take* orders, meaning create matching bids for existing buy or sell orders, you directly impact the price and secondly, you earn or lose from such trades. And because of that, you\'ll obviously try to profit, and the result is you\'re now *trading against CEX users*. You can\'t profit unless they lose. So what, you may ask?\\n- The CEX can obviously see (see the screenshot at the top) that you\'re *taking* orders i.e. trading against users, which is the first problem\\n- The second problem is they can also easily see you\'re entering short positions in one place (such as Spot) and long (such as Futures) in another, for the same pair. That is, you\'re clearly there to manipulate the price by creating artifical price swings. You\'re not either selling or buying\\n\\nWhat is the difference between a Market Maker and a regular user with an AI bot? If you\'re a Market Maker, not a Manipulator, no regulated exchange will let you do that. Even Binance (not the gold standard by any means) won\'t allow it. From the Binance link above:\\n\\n> General reminder that all projects\u2019 authorized market makers on Binance must comply with the principals and rules as follows:\\n> - Place orders for *both* bid and ask\\n> - Ensure orders remain for a certain amount of time, and prevent market disruption from high-frequency order placement and cancellations\\n\\nWhen a Market Maker violates the rules (in the Binance case), what happens is although they\'re authorized (and usually paid by someone) to make markets, provide liquidity and build trust, they start acting on behalf of other \\"customers\\" (they trade on own behalf or maybe even on behalf of other manipulators, to assist others to manipulate the market they make). Extremely bad!\\n\\nAlthough it may seem such dishonest Market Makers could simply become general exchange users and do whatever they want, that isn\'t the case. Regulated CEXes do not allow market manipulation explained above, even if it\'s done by regular users. \\n\\nDegens would object to anything that comes from the SEC, so I\'ll provide an example from the FCA (UK).\\n\\n![FCA anti-manipulation rules](/img/blog/2025-03-26_11_fca_manipulation.png)\\n\\nThere\'s more [here](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/MAR/1/6.html) and elsehwere. \\n\\nAgain, this doesn\'t mean \\"everything ought to be regulated\\". DEXes aren\'t either. But *as a customer of unregulated CEXes*, I\'m not very happy about this arrangement. These guys have low fees, but they probably \\"double-dip\\" - provide access to and collect fees from, the people who trade unethically against other customers.\\n\\n:::info\\nMost DEXes don\'t have any mechanisms that prevent price manipulation, but at least we know about this and everyone has the same access to data. That\'s not the case with unregulated CEXes.\\n\\nAdditionally, Supra L1 has features (anti-MEV, etc.) that work in favor of regular users.\\n:::\\n\\n### Spot\\n\\nThis was taken today.\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_01_dex_supra_spot.png)\\n\\nIn numeric order:\\n\\n- Trust score (a proprietary metric by Coin Gecko) is missing and who knows if the stats reported by the exchange can be trusted. Business as usual...\\n- Ridiculously high volume. What\'s going on? Good luck finding out. The exchange is not obliged to share this info or provide aggregate figures of top traders.\\n- Another pair from the same exchange has 1% of total volume on one day, 20% on another. No one asks any questions, because no one has to answer them!\\n\\nClearly there\'s a lot of \\"campaign\\" trading which would normally pique the interest of regulators or even the exchanges themselves to see if some customers are attempting to manipulate prices and hurt retail users. \\n\\n:::note\\nWhile here, check out the Spread column. It is often 0.2% or higher. We\'ll refer to this later in Cost Comparison.\\n:::\\n\\nTo give you an idea how large these changes are, here\'s a screenshot from March 25:\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Mar 24 2025 Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_01_dex_supra_spot_mar_24.png)\\n\\nAnd from March 28 (added on Mar 28):\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Mar 28 2025 Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_01_dex_supra_spot_mar_28.png)\\n\\nFrom $4 to $9 to $14 million per day in one week on no major news. Even the price hasn\'t changed since this madness begun three days ago!\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Mar 25-28 2025 Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_01_dex_supra_spot_volume_march_2025.png)\\n\\nIf I ran an exchange and saw activity jump like this, I\'d take a look to see if someone\'s abusing the platform regardless of whether \\"regulations\\" exist or not. In fact I\'d have basic checks built-in and in place for all currency pairs, 24x7, because some problems are easy to spot with automated checks. \\n\\nBut these cowboys don\'t care. Maybe you, as a retail user, couldn\'t take the pressure and dumped your Supra on March 27? SFYL! But, more volume = more fees. End of story.\\n\\n:::note\\nI used SupraScan to check the recent sends (Mar 25, 26, 27) to the CEX deposit address and didn\'t see individual deposits of over 1 million Supra. \\n\\nThe CEX Supra deposit account has ~800 million Supra in it, so it\'s possible that some users who already had money on this CEX suddenly ramped up their trading by 300% without conviction as to whether they wanted to buy or sell. But who buys or sells like that?\\n:::\\n\\n875 million Supra in this CEXes deposit wallet on Mar 28:\\n\\n![MEXC Deposit Address Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_12_cex_deposit_wallet.png)\\n\\nYesterday\'s volume in Spot was 24 hours was 1.87 billion Supra.\\n\\n![MEXC Mar 27 Spot Volume Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_12_cex_vol_mar_27.png)\\n\\n(Edit) And on April 3, not even $0.7 million (95% less).\\n\\n![MEXC Apr 03 Spot Volume Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_14_cex_vol_apr_03.png)\\n\\nI don\'t think that means \\"up 95% of volume may be manipulation\\". I think it means *at least* 95% is, and some amount of manipulation by small players is still going on.\\n\\n### Perpetual Futures aka Perps\\n\\nPerpetual futures are basically entries in a database which is a closed zero-sum system where there is **no Supra involved at all**. \\n\\nIn fact, there\'s no USD involved either! Yes, it says `SUPRA/USDT`, but understand that this Perps market doesn\'t need USDT just like it doesn\'t need SUPRA.\\n\\n- A DB is created, and named after a pair such as `SUPRA/USDT`\\n- To play, gamers deposit USDT \\"at the entrance\\" in order to be able to enter and play, but *just like Supra* (the other side of this pair), the Perps DB does not \\"use\\" USDT. It\'s just a database\\n- Next, players play against each other, and the survivors \\"unlock\\" thei USDT deposit and collect deposit of other users who\'ve lost, while the CEX retains trading revenues\\n- Players could deposit collateral in gemstones, Litecoin or something else. USDT is simply what\'s most convenient in this case because it maps 1:1 to a side in this pair\\n- Players cannot take Supra out of this market, because there\'s no Supra, as we\'ve said earlier\\n\\nNext, realize that Perps provide leverage - up to 50x. \\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Leverage](/img/blog/2025-03-26_04_dex_lev_03.png)\\n\\nThere are two interesting things about this. \\n\\nThe first is, players can deposit 10 USDT \\"at the entrance\\" and play with 500 USDT. This speeds up the CEX\'es \\"time to fleecing\\". Notice how it also makes $500 available to CEX interest-free. It\'s a closed system so as long as they liquidate overleveraged positions on time, there\'s no chance for CEX to lose here. This is obviously much better (for CEXes) and worse for their customers. Instead of hesitating to send users to Futures section (where more are likely to lose money), they employ \\"dark UI patterns\\" to *attract* users to Perps. MEXC won\'t even show Spot in its top menu once you enter Futures!\\n\\nPoint 2: with a 50x leverage you can buy, but also sell, 50x more Supra than you could normally sell. That means Perps are the place to go to smash a project or simply cause price-impacting swings in Spot SUPRA/USDT as \\"the tail is wagging the dog\\".\\n\\nBut it\'s even worse than that! We said \\"50x more Supra than you could normally sell\\", but in order to *sell* you\'d have to buy. With Perps not only do you can sell 50x more, but you don\'t have to buy any at all. You deposit USDT at the entrance, lever up 40x, smack Supra, and exit with more USDT in your pockets.\\n\\nYou may wonder why this doesn\'t equally work for buyers. \\n\\nIn truth it does, but that doesn\'t make this better. If the marketplace owner determines you\'re trading in a way meant to manipulate Spot prices - for example you\'re shorting in Perps with 40x and and have buy orders in Spot - they should step in and do something about that. These cowboy CEXes do not.\\n\\nI think unregulated cowboy exchanges don\'t do anything about it. If anything, they encourage it. \\n\\nThis is from SUPRA/USDT Perps yesterday and I think it shows a problem. In (2), Perps volume is rapidly increasing on no big changes in price before 14:26. Why would that happen?\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Perps Market Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_04_dex_perps_01.png)\\n\\nThis below is Spot. No increased volume prior to dump. And selling at scale starts at 14:26.\\n\\n![Supra/USDT Spot Market Screenshot](/img/blog/2025-03-26_04_dex_perps_02.png)\\n\\nPerps dump first, Spot follows. Seven percent drop (or over 200% profit, if you\'re leveraged 40x), on no news - the price even (almost) reocvered hours later.\\n\\nAm I \\"sure\\" this is manipulation? Of course I\'m not. As we\'ve said, we have no way to know and they don\'t have to tell us anything... \\n\\n\\"If you don\'t want to play in our casino, go elsewhere\\" is the message. Enough people want to play in these casinos that there\'s no reason for them to improve.\\n\\nI\'ve seen enough to know that they\'re often up to no good. \\n\\nEven without any forensic evidence related to the weird Market M-ing and such, evidence of dark UI patterns exist and is plentiful. \\n\\nFor example, you can see Futures from Spot.\\n\\n![MEXC Perps link](/img/blog/2025-03-26_07_dark_ui.png)\\n \\nBut you can\'t see Spot markets from Futures page... Surprise, surprise...\\n\\nIt\'s a one-way street - no one-click way back to Spot!\\n\\n![MEXC Perps page](/img/blog/2025-03-26_07_dark_ui_perps.png)\\n \\nAnd as soon as you enter, \\"Las Vegas experience\\" kicks in - there are constant promotions for reckless behavior (high leverage, commission free trading), there are casino-like pop-ups, etc.\\n\\n## DEXes\\n\\nI\'ve used the early ones on bitcoin network and it was **bad**! I remember how we\'d see a sell order, submit our matching buy order and then wait, and wait, awnd wait - usually for more than 1 hour - before we could see our order on chain (6 confirmations, remember?). Anyone who saw your order in mempool could front-run you if they wanted to pay a slightly higher transaction fee. \\n\\nThings are better now. This aren\'t \\"latest and greatest\\", but they\'re recent enough (2025). The first is DEX share in Spot volumes.\\n\\n![DEX Spot Share](/img/blog/2025-03-26_05_dex_spot.png)\\n\\nPerps are harder, as mentioned earlier, but both blockchains and DEX tech are getting better.\\n\\n![DEX Perps Share](/img/blog/2025-03-26_06_dex_perps.png)\\n\\nCEXes have noticed. See [this](https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1883329603239899346), for example:\\n\\n> We need to rethink our listing process at @coinbase\\n\\nThere are several reasons, but in January commissions from memecoin trading were huge and CEXes just couldn\'t keep up - all the action was happening on Solana, basically.\\n\\nBut it\'s not just memecoins, it\'s also \\"traditional\\" coins which probably don\'t last long enough and CEXes don\'t want to miss out. \\n\\nDEXes don\'t solve all the problems with unregulated CEXes mentioned above, and some maybe aren\'t even solvable. \\n\\nFor example, leveraged perpetual futures are also available on on-chain DEXes. But **at least** you don\'t lend your own funds to a CEX interest-free to use them against you.\\n\\n### DEX benefits to you and Supra ecosystem\\n\\nI\'ll keep this simple because it ought to be obvious and it was explained at the top:\\n\\n- Better transparency, fairness and more disclosure than unregulated CEXes\\n- Convenience, performance and features are **very close** - it\'s good enough for non-professionals\\n- Supra-based DEXes trade on-chain, chain earns revenue, more people buy Supra to pay for those fees\\n- Supra-based DEXes need liquidity. You can stake DEX pools and make money doing that\\n\\nIt\'s also a way to distribute risk for your \\"active\\" Supra stash - part of your tokens that moves more often, as opposed to staked Supra that is likely quite static. \\nYou may do something like this:\\n- 1/3 of active stash on a regulated CEX if you feel the need to day trade from time to time (some people prefer unregulatd; I do too, but not any of the current ones)\\n- 1/3 in Staking or LP Staking on Supra-based DEX number 1 (e.g. Dexlyn)\\n- 1/3 on Staking or LP Staking on Supra-based DEX number 2 (e.g. Atmos)\\n\\n### Slippage and fees\\n\\nEveryone knows Supra is fast and transaction costs are very low, Supra\'s DORA (Distributed Oracles) provides up to date price feeds quickly, but one \\"sensitive\\" bit about DEXes is slippage and fees. \\n\\nThere isn\'t enough independent detailed information available to compare, but anecodtally:\\n\\n- A low cost, unregulated CEX may have a 0.05% \\"taker\\" fee (example [here](https://www.mexc.com/fee))\\n- Dexlyn may have a 0.3% commission and \\"slippage\\" that\'s to be kept at below 0.5% (default permitted slippage setting)\\n\\nThe problem is we don\'t really know how it behaves (slippage). From my experience with smaller (below $1,000) amounts, Dexlyn worked fine when I compared the price from that UI with CEX prices in another browser.\\n\\n:::info\\nMaybe this doesn\'t work that great with larger orders, but I haven\'t seen any evidence, so I can\'t conclude much from unsubstantiated \\"concern trolling\\". \\n\\nYes, perhaps, if you Swap $10,000 today, you\'d be hit with 2% slippage. It\'s theoretically possible. But don\'t do $10K at a time if you notice at $2K it\'s already higher than 0.5%!\\n:::\\n\\nFor normal retail use swapping on Dexlyn right now will cost you **up to 0.8%** (up to 0.5% slippage plus fixed 0.3% commission). It can be below 0.5% - **less** than you pay at a low-cost deregulated CEX!\\n\\nThis may change for better or worse, but it\'s quite simple and low-risk: don\'t use a crap DEX you\'ve never heard of and run small tests before ramping up like a degen! Transactions take seconds, so I\'m sure you can spend 30 seconds trying with $10, $50, and $100 before you try with $500. They also have a Testnet to try with fake coins first.\\n\\nSupra Network makes it possible to address most of those problems, so while slippage has historically been a week spot for DEXes, it\'s not supposed to happen on Supra if DEXes make good use of those L1 features.\\n\\nNow let\'s see about some of the current DEXes.\\n\\n### Dexlyn\\n\\nThis one\'s been in poduction since February. No bad news so far. \\n\\nTwo audits. Swapping and bridging work well for me:\\n\\n- I usually Swap Supra into dexUSDC\\n- Another thing I do is I send ERC-20 USDC tokens to Dexlyn from Ethereum newtork, to fund my dexUSDC address\\n\\nCurrent disadvantages:\\n- Swap only (same as CEX \\"Market Order\\")\\n- Only SUPRA/dexUSDC (and dexUSDC is Dexlyn-wrapped ERC20 USDC)\\n\\nThey started just last month so obviously these are temporary. They recently said they\'re going to add more currency pairs and Perps, so I think major updates are coming.\\n\\nWhile I\'ve said Perps are bad (and that\'s true) the fact is there\'s demand and they\'ll have to be LP-stakeds, so it\'s less bad than on deregulated CEXes. Secondly, some of the LP stake will be in Supra as well, unlike on CEXes where the entire Perps system is funded with (essentialy) fake US dollars.\\n\\n:::info\\nDexlyn uses own bridge, and has passed two audits. \\n\\nThey also have multiple dApps, so do your own research, to see what was audited, by whom, and how.\\n:::\\n\\nSwap dApp: https://app.dexlyn.com/\\n\\n### Atmos\\n\\nCurrently in Testnet, getting close to Mainnet.\\n\\nI haven\'t used it on Mainnet yet, but Atmos Testnet looks very nice.\\n\\nUnique features on their roadmap:\\n\\n- Down-Cost Averaging (DCA) may be delivered before Dexlyn\'s since it\'s already in the UI\\n- Limit orders - also something that Dexyn does not have, as \\"Swap\\" is like \\"Market\\" order on CEX\\n- More pairs - their Testnet currently features USDC, ETH, BTC, but I haven\'t looked at how they do it\\n\\nTheir documentation has more details on their roadmap, but I highlight the three distinguishing ones.\\n\\n:::info\\nI believe Atmos won\'t use Dexlyn\'s Ethereum bridge, so it may be \\"logically segregated\\" risk-wise (although L1 itself is \\"shared\\").\\n:::\\n\\nAtmos dApp: https://app.atmosprotocol.com/\\n\\n### Solido\\n\\nSolido is different. Currently also Testnet-only.\\n\\nTheir stablecoin (which Atmos on Testnet already has in its pools) is an over-collateralized synthetic USD stablecoin.\\n\\nSo yes, it\'s a \\"fake USD\\" - like USDT, but with crypto collateral. And Supra\'s DORA is used for price feeds, obviously, to figure out what\'s the right exchange rates (and sufficient levels of collateral) ought to be.\\n\\n:::note\\nThis may seem like a lot more risk than USDT, but is it really?\\n\\nIt\'s collateralized, so unlike USDT which is backed by the non-independently audited Tether, CIRCLE token is backed by other cryptocurrency tokens/assets.\\n:::\\n\\nThe UI is a bit confusing, but I like the platform. It\'s not a \\"DEX\\", which is why they work with Atmos, but if you want to swap CIRCLE to SUPRA, or borrow CIRCLE and not (for example) USDC, it may be easier to just use Solido for everything.\\n\\nYou can borrow CIRCLE with Supra (or other) collateral, and you can do stuff with CIRCLE in Atmos or elsewhere where they accept it. Neat idea.\\n\\nYou can also stake on Solido to earn yield.\\n\\nI have not checked any security- or design-related docs so I can\'t speak to that.\\n\\nSolido (testnet) dApp: https://testnet.solido.money/\\n\\n### What else is coming\\n\\nCheck each of these projects\' roadmaps, but also check [Supra DeFi Revolution](https://supra.com/defi-revolution/) for more on what\'s coming to Supra and what these three projects will build upon.\\n\\n## Cost comparison\\n\\nEveryone should make their own and DEXes could build Web tools to help users decide based on their own circumstances and requirements. \\n\\nI\'m not aware of any such tool so I did this based on fixed assumptions:\\n- CEX: 50 orders a year with 100% of funds, 0.05% taker and 0% maker fee, with half of time in each category (avg. fee (0.05 + 0.00) / 2)\\n- DEX: 12 orders a year with 50% of funds each time, 0.3% commission with 0.2% slippage, 50% traded and 50% staked 3/4 of time (compounding is not taken into account)\\n- All trades are neutral (no profit)\\n\\n:::note\\n0.2% DEX slippage seems realistic for smaller orders, especially since CEX spread (usually 0.2% or more - see `Spread` column in the CEX markets table in the screenshot at the top) is not even assumed.\\n:::\\n\\n![CEX vs DEX](/img/blog/2025-03-26_08_cex_vs_dex_cost_comparison.png)\\n\\nThe first assumption is you take it easy and trade less frequently. This may not work for some, as we already know.\\n\\nThe DEX stakingassumption is that whenever you are not trading, you can have your funds in a DEX staking pool. You can unlock some (such as 50%) or all, wait until it\'s unlocked, trade, and commit funds to the pool again until next time. There are risks to staking as well, but there are less volatile pools (e.g. USDC/USDT), too. And I assumed a modest 10% APR.\\n\\nThe other two dApps aren\'t on mainnet yet so I\'ll use Dexlyn\'s staking APR to illustrate this point: Supra/dexSDC often yields over 15%. \\n\\n![Dexlyn Staking APR](/img/blog/2025-03-26_09_dex_staking.png)\\n\\nIn stablecoin pools, a 10% APR isn\'t rare. If you\'re bullish on Supra and want to \\"go long\\" while minimizing the need to trade, you can now (that Supra is just 0.6 cents) stake 30% in SUPRA/dexUSDC and the rest in stablecoin pools, to get a blended APR of 11.5% and retain some exposure to potential Supra appreciation (\\"Impermanent Gain\\", in DEX parlance, within the Supra-staking pool).\\n\\nThe bottom line is, if you don\'t trade a lot you won\'t be worse off using a DEX and these are just the **direct** benefits. \\n\\nI wasn\'t entirely happy with the assumptions, so here\'s another version:\\n- CEX stash is idle, trade amounts are 50% of total (most regular users don\'t do this, they trade 20-30% or DCA)\\n- 50% of DEX capital is in staking, the other 50% is fully liquid and trades\\n\\n![DEX vs CEX Cost Comparison](/img/blog/2025-03-26_10_dex_cex_monthly.png)\\n\\nDEX Trading (yellow) costs more than CEX Trading (blue), but DEX Staking (red) makes up for it and DEX comes out ahead (green).\\n\\nAssumptions used here were only slightly different.\\n\\n```raw\\nStarting amount (SUPRA)\\t1000\\nCEX Maker Fee %\\t0\\nCEX Taker Fee %\\t0.05%\\nCEX Maker/Taker % 50%\\nCEX Trades/Mo\\t1\\nCEX Slippage %\\t0.20%\\n\\nDEX Trades/Mo\\t1\\nDEX Slippage %\\t0.30%\\nDEX Swap Fee %\\t0.30%\\nDEX Staking %\\t50.00%\\nDEX Unlocked %\\t50.00%\\nDEX APR %\\t10.00%\\n```\\n\\nAs only one half of the CEX amount is used, decline due to fees and spreads is slow. On DEX it\'s higher, but even with the entire Trading stash being liquid all the time, staking gains manage to offset higher costs (fee & slippage) of DEX.\\n\\n| Month | CEX Amount | DEX Staking | DEX Trading | DEX Sum   |\\n|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\\n| 1     | 998.88     | 503.99      | 497.00      | 1,000.98 |\\n| 2     | 997.75     | 508.00      | 494.02      | 1,002.02  |\\n| 3     | 996.63     | 512.06      | 491.05      | 1,003.11  |\\n| 4     | 995.51     | 516.14      | 488.11      | 1,004.25  |\\n| 5     | 994.39     | 520.25      | 485.18      | 1,005.43  |\\n| 6     | 993.27     | 524.40      | 482.27      | 1,006.67  |\\n| 7     | 992.15     | 528.58      | 479.37      | 1,007.96  |\\n| 8     | 991.04     | 532.80      | 476.50      | 1,009.29  |\\n| 9     | 989.92     | 537.04      | 473.64      | 1,010.68  |\\n| 10    | 988.81     | 541.33      | 470.80      | 1,012.12  |\\n| 11    | 987.69     | 545.64      | 467.97      | 1,013.61  |\\n| 12    | 986.58     | 549.99      | 465.16      | 1,015.16  |\\n| **Total** | **987.69** | **549.99** | **467.97** | **1,013.61** |\\n\\nIf you trade just once a month, there\'s no reason to not stake the \\"trading half of your DEX stash, and unstake when you want to DCA or trade. \\n\\nWith such optimization (especially when Supra\'s AutoFi comes out, this aproach could be easy to fully automated) you could probably do weekly trades on DEX without being worse off.\\n\\n:::info\\nSupra\'s AutoFi is expected to have associated service and transaction fees, but for anyone with a couple of thousand dollars in assets it shouldn\'t change the outcome of above calculation.\\n:::\\n\\n### Anecdotal example\\n\\nOn April 4, I tested slippage by swapping enough Supra (close to 1500) to get $10 dexUSDC.\\n\\n![Anecdotal example with 1492 SUPRA to 10 dexUSDC Dexlyn Swap](/img/blog/2025-03-26_15_dex_swap_01.png)\\n\\nSupraScan view showed a small 7.4611 Supra \\"refund\\" (below). Notice the \\"refund\\" was deducted from the amount sent (above). Maybe that was because slippage was lower than the allowed maximum of 0.5%.\\n\\n![Anecdotal example Swap TX on Dexlyn](/img/blog/2025-03-26_15_dex_swap_02.png)\\n\\nTwo minutes later I traded 1500 Supra for USDT on a CEX: 1500 Supra at market price. Taker\'s fee was $0.004966 (0.05%). I received 9.992334 USDT. MEXC has no withdrawal fees, so that\'s the end.\\n\\n![CEX Swap 1500 to 10 USD](/img/blog/2025-03-26_15_dex_swap_03.png)\\n\\n- DEX: 0.006700965 (9.9993/1492.218)\\n- CEX: 0.006666 (9.992334/1500)\\n\\n:::note\\nI will put this in a note rather than form a \\"conclusion\\": stablecoin amount I got for Supra at a DEX was **better** than than what I got at a CEX by 1.005392094x (0.52%). However:\\n\\n- there was a two minute lag between these transactions and the price constantly fluctuates\\n- each CEX has different prices and spreads\\n\\nSo the conclusion may as well be \\"there\'s no statistically significant difference\\". \\n\\nThat\'s why this should really be done as a study across many transactions. But you won\'t find that anywhere in April 2025, so at least this blog provides some anecdotal evidence.\\n:::\\n\\nFor further reference and research, note that in this particular case the CEX pair spread was 0.29%, on top of which a 0.05% taker fee was added (total: 0.36% - higher than Dexlyn Swap fee of 0.3%).\\n\\n![CEX Spread](/img/blog/2025-03-26_15_dex_swap_04.png)\\n\\nIn addition to advantages that we may realize in own Swaps or other trades, DEXes help Supra price growth. I can\'t think of a single downside for the Supra ecosystem if you pull most of your active stash from a CEX.\\n\\n## Take-aways and call to action\\n\\nThe current lot of unregulated exchanges that run Supra Spot market are in my opinion not good *hombres*, folks.\\n\\nWe have a solution: several in fact. Dexlyn today and two more are coming soon.\\n\\nMove at least 50% of your active stash to DEXes, and optionally split the risk among them (for example, 50% of DEX LP funds on Dexlyn, 40% on Atmos, 10% in Solido). When you need coins to trade, unstake them. When they\'re not being traded, they earn yield and strenghten the ecosystem. \\n\\n:::info\\nI mentioned Dexlyn and Atmos may use different DEX and bridge tech and you can also split those among two wallets to have the DEX part of \\"active stash\\" segreagated on both dApp and wallet level.\\n\\nDEXes and CEX havees different risk profiles and attack vectors, so holding 50% of your active stash in a regulated CEX isn\'t \\"more\\" or \\"less\\" risky - it\'s just risky in different ways.\\n:::\\n\\nThat arrangement benefits the Supra ecosystem much more than providing CEXes with free liquidity which is mostly used to damage both holders and the token.\\n\\nIt\'s good for your staking, it\'s good for your LPing, it\'s good for the price, and so on. \\n\\nThere are virtually no downsides unless you day trade. For many it can be cheaper. I didn\'t even realize that until I started writing this post.\\n\\nIt is true that some CEXes let you stake coins parked there, but none support Supra staking and and even when they do you can make more by staking on your own which in StarKey is easy.\\n\\nRemember that this approach not only benefits your \\"active stash\\", but it also benefits the Supra Network, Supra dApp creators including DEXes, and many others. \\n\\nIt\'s a good idea to have some Supra at a CEX. It\'s a different risk profile, it\'s convenient, you don\'t need 20 different wallets, etc.\\n\\nI won\'t recommend any particular CEX, but my own plan is to move to a **regulated** CEX. I didn\'t expect I\'d every want to do that, but now I do. After watching the current unregulated exchanges since Supra\'s launch (four months now), I don\'t like what I see. Unregualted CEXes could do a better job without anyone forcing them, but they prefer not to."},{"id":"2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-19-supra-suprans-sns-hex-names.md","title":"SupraNS (SNS) names with hexadecimal symbols","description":"SupraNS names available for purchase","date":"2025-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"}],"readingTime":5.605,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names","title":"SupraNS (SNS) names with hexadecimal symbols","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["supra"],"description":"SupraNS names available for purchase","keywords":["supra","starkey","suprans","name","name system","hex","hex name"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Supra holders, move active stashes to a DEX","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/26/move-supra-to-dex"},"nextItem":{"title":"Buy my SupraNS names","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/23/supra-suprans-names-for-sale"}},"content":"Today I registered some hex names.\\n\\nThey\'re not just \\"fancy\\" but have use cases, one of which I just added to [SupraNS](https://suprans.name). Such names are not novel, but they\'re rarely used and, in my opinion, interesting. So I\'ll write a few words about that.\\n\\nSay you get a SNs name that consists of hexadecimal symbols (`[0-9][A-F]`). Example: `b00b5`. \\n\\nIs that interesting and/or useful? Let\'s take a closer look.\\n\\n## Downsides of hex SNS names\\n\\nA \\"hex name\\" can be dangerous if you get autocorrected when entering such SNS names. For example, a payee may end up entering `boobs.supra` in StarKey wallet and send funds to the wrong address.\\n\\nBut that risk depends on the name and whether the \\"wrong\\" SNS exists (in many cases it would). Most names shouldn\'t get autocorrected (especially not `b00b5`). In some cases hex names will be less autocorrect-prone because they may not match common misspellings (thanks to the fact that they usually contain digits).\\n\\nAnother danger is visual confusion, where someone misreads `1abe1.supra` and sends funds to `label.supra`. One workaround is to register the both SNS names. Another is to not make such mistakes (e.g. use a good font, or advise your counterparty to use copy-and-paste rather than view-and-retype when entering your SNS hex address).\\n\\n## Benefits of hex SNS names\\n\\nFirst, they\'re fancy and can be `c001` (somebody snapped this one before me).\\n\\nSecond, they cay be practical. If you create a wallet address that matches your SupraNS name for easy address recognition (e.g. in SupraScan.io or API output), it\'s easier to use or develop. For example, I may have SNS `b00b5.supra` mapped to wallet address `b00b57fef64e98e838eef231215dd0e7fa634d2fd70e75ae50df3a2959eba2f4`.\\n\\nOr, the proverbial Alice may be `boob5` + `a`, which allows me up to 26 test addresses for easy testing:\\n```raw\\nalice.b00b5.supra # b00b5a7fef64e98e838eef231215dd0e7fa634d2fd70e75ae50df3a2959eba2f\\njane.b00b5.supra  # b00b5j16c6bde199856efd1204ae840d21e3a26d0c501fb1521a0d9f7302934d\\n```\\n\\nAnother example, in Russian.\\n\\n![Advanced example of the use of hex addresses (Russian)](/img/blog/hex-names-proper-use.png)\\n\\nOr `00[0-9].0b1a57.supra` could be created in SNS and mapped to 10 vanity addresses (`0x0b1a57[0-9]...`). Or we could continue with hex symbols and point `facade.0b1a57.supra` to `0xfacade....`, `decade.0b1a57.supra` to `0xdecade...` and so on. You get the idea - it can be done nicely!\\n\\nAn example in Japanese with vanity sub-domain addresses and Japanese sub-domain names (*eiga*, *ato*):\\n\\n![Advanced example of the use of hex addresses (Japanese)](/img/blog/hex-names-proper-use-japanese.png)\\n\\n:::note\\nNote that StarKey won\'t create vanity addresses for you. Even if it could, it\'d be slow for anything but 3 letters. \\n\\nYou\'d have to generate such addresses outside and import their private key to StarKey. You probably don\'t need that for SupraScan.io, CLI or API use cases but it can be useful - for example, it\'s easy to find and share your wallet address `0x0b1a571...` without SNS. There may 2-3 partially matching wallets but even in that case you could easily identify yours by looking at the transaction history.\\n:::\\n\\n## Other notes\\n\\nSNS names can be as short as 3 single-byte characters. \\n\\nLong hex names are impractical: hard to read, hard to tyype. If you combine two \\"hex words\\" (say, `b19b00b5`), that\'s probably the upper limit. Three words are usually hard to read. And `-` isn\'t a hexadecimal symbol, so `b19-b00b5` is possible in SNS but can\'t be mapped to a wallet address.\\n\\nThe last bit is related to those who want to use vanity addresses. Today it\'s still quite hard to generate them for 7 or more characters.\\n\\nTherefore I recommend SNS length of hex names to be in the range 3-6 (characters). If you don\'t plan to use vanity addresses, then up to 10(-ish) may be fine, assuming you don\'t pick a lame name.\\n\\n#### Unexpected behavior of Supra CLI\\n\\nThis probably isn\'t of concern to almost anyone, but some may want to know: when it comes to SNS Supra CLI (maybe Aptos CLI as well) behaves in a way that violates Move\'s principles (or at least user\'s expectations).\\n\\nLet\'s say `0xb00b1ad3c5a95d02f245b938b2f1f325450bf75e4d7714e3b89607be7b6038ab` resolves to `deface.supra`.\\n\\nIn StarKey, you can send Supra to either and it will be well received.\\n\\nBut if you try to automate that from SUPRA CLI and send 1 SUPRA to address:deface using the Supra CLI, this is where it\'ll go to`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000deface`.\\n\\nI got a comment saying \\"but that is expected\\" as `address` only deals with hex strings and the Supra CLI can\'t resolve (or even isn\'t suppose to resolve) SNS. \\n\\nBut why wouldn\'t the CLI not resolve SNS addresses? They\'re on chain, after all!\\n\\nYou may say they shouldn\'t be resolved because the correct type for address field is, so `deface` is correctly interpreted to mean `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000deface`.\\n\\nI don\'t disagree, but my the Move Language is supposed to not do unpredictable stuff and I think interpreting `address:deface` the way it does is unpredictable. Why?\\n\\nBecause *no one can possibly have such an address*, sending tokens to `address:deface` is **guaranteed to burn them**. A person who wants to burn tokens on mainnet is unlikely to use `address:deface` (maybe it\'d be OK for `address:burn` if that was a \\"well known\\" burn address for the network).\\n\\nIn my opinion the right way that still sticks to the strict \\"rules\\" would be:\\n\\n- For an address provided as STRING, where string length is less than 10 bytes (as is the case with `deface`), try to resolve it in SNS. If not resolvable or if there\'s no SNS resolution in the CLI, exit with error.\\n- For strings longer than 10 bytes, resolve in SNS and refuse to send if it resolvable (because it might be ambiguous). Currently - since the CLI can\'t query SNS - it\'d be right to send these to wallet prefixed with `0x` and padded with zeros. Maybe unexpected, but still \\"technically correct\\". \\n\\nIt\'s a subtle thing, but if I were a Supra or Aptos developer, I\'d do this at the minimum:\\n- Introduce \\"well known\\" short burn addresses (less than 10 characters)\\n- For all others, fail (i.e. refuse to pad with 0s and send to a random burn address unless the string (in `address:string`) is longer than 9 characters) unless SNS resolution can be successfully done and the string found\\n\\n## Where to buy or register hex names\\n\\nI registered a bunch of hex names according to the above considerations: most are 3-6 characters and therefore suitable for pairing with vanity addresses. Some are longer, but I registered only those long hex names that I really liked.\\n\\nYou can find them by sorting the table of available names by Comment and looking for comments that contain hex symbols.\\n\\nSome good ones (including 3 letter names) are still available through Dexlyn\'s [SupraNS dApp](https://suprans.id/names).\\n\\n## Update (March 25, 2025)\\n\\nSupraNS names are now transferable directly from Dexlyn\'s dApp UI.\\n\\nThere\'s no marketplace yet, but we have been gifting and exchanging names in a trusted way."},{"id":"2025/02/23/supra-suprans-names-for-sale","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/02/23/supra-suprans-names-for-sale","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-23-supra-suprans-names-for-sale.md","title":"Buy my SupraNS names","description":"SupraNS names available for purchase","date":"2025-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"}],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/02/23/supra-suprans-names-for-sale","title":"Buy my SupraNS names","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["supra"],"description":"SupraNS names available for purchase","keywords":["supra","starkey","suprans","name","name system","ens","dns"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-02-23_suprans_name.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SupraNS (SNS) names with hexadecimal symbols","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/19/supra-suprans-sns-hex-names"},"nextItem":{"title":"Two xx validator nodes added to pool-blocking pool","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/12/xx-anti-pool-pool-adds-two-nodes"}},"content":"I\'ve registered a few SupraNS names to keep them until those who want them decide to buy them... or not.\\n\\n:::info\\nSupraNS is the officicial name system of the Supra network.\\n\\nIts function is similar to what ENS does on the Ethereum network: initially it will be used for wallet address aliasing.\\n\\nYou can find more about it at the link below and in the official documentation (linked from the site below).\\n:::\\n\\nCurrently Supra has just one wallet, StarKey, and StarKey is about to add SupraNS support for addresses in coming days or weeks. \\n\\nAt that time SupraNS names will become useful. Currently they have just one use: speculation, which is what I\'ve been doing.\\n\\nAnother important feature that\'s still missing is the ability to transfer SupraNS registration ownership. \\n\\nBecause of that there are no marketplaces for SupraNS trading either, but that\'s precisely why I listed mine on a Web site: I\'ve no idea when that may become available which is why I\'m posting those SupraNS names on a Web site.\\n\\n:::note\\nEdit (April 6, 2024): The first marketplace for SupraNS is now live - tradeport.xyz.

I plan to use escrow service provided by someone in the Supra community, and will commit to transferring the name if the agreed-upon payment is promptly made to the person who helps with escrow.\\n\\nTransfers can\'t happen before the API becomes available, but prices may be agreed upon and funds transferred *before* SupraNS becomes popular and before Internet auctions become available.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe site has the prices, too, but those are not fixed (as explained on the site). \\n\\nI\'ll probably use them as initial prices in auctions on a SupraNS marketplace.\\n:::\\n\\nTo be honest, I don\'t think the prices of SupraNS names will be anywhere close to Solana\'s (let alone Ethereum\'s), but that\'s not relevant. \\n\\nInitially SupraNS registrations were very cheap. After the first 10,000 registrations were reached the doubled the prices and they\'ll hike them again after 15,000 registrations which should happen within days of StarKey adding support for SupraNS. Now most StarKey users have no idea about SupraNS.\\n\\nI would definiively recommend SupraNS to StarKey users and to anyone who runs a business on Supra because it\'s a useful feature. It\'s been useful on all chains and it will be on this one as well. But speculating in hem may be risky. \\n\\nFor that same reason I\'m not going to hype these or claim that these \\"may\\" become a source of huge profits (10-baggers!). I don\'t think that will happen. Buy \'em if you need \'em.\\n\\n:::note\\nI actually have more than those that I\'ve listed at SupraNS.name, but for various reasons I\'m not rushing to sell them.\\n\\nMore on that and other SupraNS

Introduction\\n\\nBecause of gross incompetence in XX Community (not all of them, but more than enough to paralyze any corrective action in the DAO), the network is suffering from pool infestation.\\n\\nI recently started \\"validating with a twist\\" (more about that [here](/blog/2025/01/27/xx-network-armchairancap-pool-blocking-update) and earlier posts), and block validator pools using my own pool.\\n\\n## Two new nodes added\\n\\nToday I\'ve got two more nodes online, so now I have five. \\n\\nThis is already one node too many - considering that cMix (mixnet) group size is five - but that is the very problem the XX Network community won\'t do anything about.\\n\\nI tried to talk some sense into them, but they won\'t listen so now I\'m just one of several centralized pools who run more nodes than it takes to form a random mixnet group.\\n\\n## Blocking-related update\\n\\nIn line with the original purpose, the new nodes are blocking a pool I already target on the older three nodes. \\n\\nThose leeches recently added their 9th node, so I\'ve added the node IP to the firewall on the older three nodes, and it\'s included in the new nodes as well.\\n\\nNow it\'s \\"5 vs. 9\\" - I\'m catching up on them!\\n\\nBut... does it work? \\n\\nSome examples of the failed joint rounds (you can verify in XX Network Dashboard) for one of the nodes (moneyteam_03) in past

Or they can nominate a reputable non-pool validator and take it easy.\\n:::\\n\\n## What\'s next and closing thoughts\\n\\n### Pool and Blocking\\n\\nThe next is one more node when I have time, to get to six elected, and then add another pool to my blocking list.\\n\\nWith six nodes I\'ll start gathering aggregate damaage as I hope to hit 3,000 cMix points per day in damage.\\n\\n### Community \\n\\nThe tragedy of this situation is while my anti-pool pool works extremely well, to highlight the disaster those xx Network Marxists (how about \\"Marxxists\\"?) have created I need to grow my pool and amplify the problem which I\'m trying to solve.\\n\\n- I don\'t cause any timeouts (as they happen in pre-computation stage)\\n- Blocking causes all nodes (including mine) involved in randomly-selected cMix groups formed to process rounds to fail, failing to earn\\n- Other mixnet rounds with nodes I don\'t target work as usual\\n- The more nodes I run, the more economically unattractive centralized pooling becomes, but also the more xx coins I have to sell to fund my own pool, which depresses the price for everyone.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe longer the community takes to do something about it, the more nodes I create and the more xx coins I sell on MEXC.\\n:::\\n\\nAs a reminder, the Marxxists have fought against:\\n\\n- Hiking the minimum validator share (now only 15,000 XX or US$500 - the clowns to keep the old minimum that was 1/15th of that amount), which made it easy for pools to stand up many nodes on the cheap (and it still does)\\n- Public announcement that pools (of over 4 nodes) are **not** welcome on xx Network\\n- Any \\"soft\\" KYC to be able to encourage - merely *encourage*! - nominators to nominate validator nodes who are **not** owned by the same owner\\n- Refused to consider any other action such as shrinking the number of validator slots, beause we don\'t need 370 - 300 or 250 would do, it\'s just a matter of right-sizing when/if necessary\\n\\nAlternatively, they could have come with own, better ideas and they\'ve had **years** to do it. \\n\\n:::note\\nAs an example, we could have even introduced community- and privacy-friendly permissioned validation in which new validators would be approved based on a community vote and simple attestation done by a 3rd party registrar. Or even self-attestation.\\n\\nNo documents required, just an on-chain vote. Yeah, no. One of the most idiotic arguments they had was \\"validators deserve the right to privacy\\". \\n:::\\n\\nInstead, when cMix users wonder about the risks of having the same pool owner mixing their entire round, the Marxxists be like that famous Border Czar:\\n\\n![Marxxists\' in action](/img/blog/2025-02-12-xx-marxxists-do-nothing.jpg)\\n\\nIt\'s one thing to be unable to fix a problem because it\'s hard, and entirely another to willingly make it worse by rejecting all proposals becuase \\"there\'s no problem to be solved\\".\\n\\nWhat\'s even more laughable, yesterday they told me my *three* nodes were a problem, but all the pools out there have been running for years at 100% commission and they\'re not a problem.\\n\\n![Marxxists\' double standards](/img/blog/2025-02-12-xx-marxxists.jpg)\\n\\nBecause they fought against any and all meaningful improvements, now I can run a large pool just like everyone does so here I am with five active validator nodes...\\n\\nOne my two new nodes was elected with just a 140K XX stake on it. That\'s what makes it possible to easily stand up and elect a bunch of nodes.\\n\\nOne of the suggestions I made was to slash my validator addresses 100%. \\n\\nFive nodes times 20K XX is 100K xx which is now about US$3,500. If they want to take that step and slash one of few validators that care, be my guest! \\n\\nI recognize this isn\'t the best use of my time so I could use some help to leave this failing community. Slashing my validator wallets 100% would help me more much than it helps the project, so bring it!"},{"id":"2025/02/09/xx-coin-in-supra-starkey-wallet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/02/09/xx-coin-in-supra-starkey-wallet","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-09-xx-coin-in-supra-starkey-wallet.md","title":"How to add WXX (ERC-20) xx coin to Supra StarKey","description":"How to add WXX to Supra StarKey and get access to Supra DEX services","date":"2025-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"},{"label":"supra","permalink":"/blog/tags/supra"}],"readingTime":8.205,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/02/09/xx-coin-in-supra-starkey-wallet","title":"How to add WXX (ERC-20) xx coin to Supra StarKey","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain","supra"],"description":"How to add WXX to Supra StarKey and get access to Supra DEX services","keywords":["xx network","economics","validator","supra","dex","starkey"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-02-09_07_new_tokens_in_starkey.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Two xx validator nodes added to pool-blocking pool","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/12/xx-anti-pool-pool-adds-two-nodes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Update on pool-blocking progress","permalink":"/blog/2025/01/27/xx-network-armchairancap-pool-blocking-update"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [Non-native tokens/coins/NFTs in StarKey](#non-native-tokenscoinsnfts-in-starkey)\\n- [WXX contract](#wxx-contract)\\n- [Get StarKey](#get-starkey)\\n- [Add WXX to StarKey](#add-wxx-to-starkey)\\n- [Why do all this?](#why-do-all-this)\\n  - [Supra DEXes](#supra-dexes)\\n  - [xx coin and Supra ecosystem](#xx-coin-and-supra-ecosystem)\\n    - [SupraNS](#suprans)\\n- [How to buy Supra](#how-to-buy-supra)\\n- [HOw to buy WXX](#how-to-buy-wxx)\\n- [Next steps](#next-steps)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nStarKey wallet is the native wallet for Supra L1. \\n\\nxx coin is the native token of xx Network, a L1 network with integrated mixnet services for post-quantum privacy. \\n\\nWXX is an XX Foundation-issued, Ethereum-wrapped ERC20 token. It is also used on Uniswap DEX.\\n\\nThis post explores StarKey for xx coin users (and speculators).\\n\\n## Non-native tokens/coins/NFTs in StarKey\\n\\nSupra StarKey is expanding its token support and currently support for 20 or so is natively built-in. What about the smalle ones, such as xx coin?\\n\\nAccording to [StarKey FAQs](https://starkey.app/faq):\\n\\n> As of now, StarKey supports a variety of tokens, including all ERC-20 tokens, as well as tokens on the Aptos, Sui, and Solana blockchains\\n\\nThis looks promising. Let\'s try!\\n\\n## WXX contract\\n\\nGo to contract address and copy contract (`Token Contract (WITH 9 Decimals)` on right-hand side).\\n\\nI got it from [https://etherscan.io/token/0x171120219d3223E008558654ec3254A0F206edb2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x171120219d3223E008558654ec3254A0F206edb2), but I suggest you get it from Uniswap by yourself.\\n\\n## Get StarKey\\n\\nDownload StarKey by following links from the official site (www.supra.com) or the [StarKey app](https://starkey.app/) page. \\n\\nCurrently desktop versions have more features, but I can\'t think of any that would interfere with WXX. \\n\\nI used StarKey on Chromium.\\n\\n## Add WXX to StarKey\\n\\n:::warning\\nMake a backup of your StarKey pass phrase. Like with other non-custodial walles, there\'s no other way to get access.\\n:::\\n\\nThe pencil icon is where you toggle display (ON/OFF) of existing tokens. But WXX does not exist, so we need to add it.\\n\\n![StarKey - Edit Tokens](/img/blog/2025-02-09_01_edit_tokens.png)\\n\\nOnce in Manage Token page, you can toggle other tokens (Solana, etc.), but to add WXX you need to click on the `+` icon to add a custom token.\\n\\n![StarKey - Add Custom Token](/img/blog/2025-02-09_02_add_custom_token.png)\\n\\nThis is where the WXX contract is needed:\\n\\n- Network: Ethereum\\n- Contract: paste the WXX contract address you got earlier\\n\\nThe rest will be auto-populated.\\n\\n![StarKey - Add WXX Contract](/img/blog/2025-02-09_03_add_wxx.png)\\n\\nYou have added `WXX`!\\n\\n![StarKey - Add Custom Token Complete](/img/blog/2025-02-09_04_wxx_added.png)\\n\\nNow you can go back to `Manage Tokens` (the pencil icon). Use the magnifying glass icon to find `WXX` and click the star to make the token a favorite.\\n\\n![StarKey - Toggle and Fav Token](/img/blog/2025-02-09_05_fav_wxx.png)\\n\\nFinally, we can click on WXX to receive or send (ETH is required for transaction fees) WXX. \\n\\n![StarKey - WXX in your wallet](/img/blog/2025-02-09_07_new_tokens_in_starkey.png)\\n\\n:::tip\\nI encountered a problem with StarKey v2.1.2 in this last step: no coins - built-in or manually added - with zero balance would be displayed. \\n\\nA workaround I discovered:\\n- Click on `All Networks` at the top \\n- Click on `Testnet` and then again on `Mainnets` and return to wallet\\n\\nThat makes all zero-balance coins appear in view. They may disappear again, but at least you can copy an addresses to fund it and make it a non-zero balance address, or repeat the workaround to view them again at any time.\\n:::\\n\\n## Why do all this?\\n\\nThe display problem is temporary and maybe you won\'t even notice it.\\n\\nWhy bother in the first place? Several reasons.\\n\\n### Supra DEXes\\n\\nWXX in your StarKey will (eventually) be trade-able on Supra DEXes. \\n\\nCurrently, one is online (Dexlyn) and more are coming (Atmos, for example).\\n\\nBut again - why bother? \\n\\n- Low cost: Dexlyn\'s DEX charges 0.3% and transaction fees are negligible\\n- Fast: transactions take seconds\\n- The first native stablecoin on Supra is Dexlyn\'s dexUSDC, which is USDC (ERC-20) wrapped on Supra L1 using Dexlyn\'s [Ethereum bridge](https://app.dexlyn.com/bridge), so you will be able to\\n  - Trade xx coin for dexUSDC\\n  - Exit/enter with WXX and USDC (ERC-20)\\n\\n:::info\\nDexlyn DEX does not yet support a variety of coins - it just launched last week.\\n\\nThe above will be possible when generic ERC-20 coins/tokens become supported on Dexlyn DEX. You would then add your own pairs (such as dexWXX/dexUSDC).\\n\\nAlternatively - see below - wait for Supra\'s own cross-chain support.\\n:::\\n\\nAs an example of low fees, here\'s [an example](https://suprascan.io/tx/0x530fb379a0083bb5c9fda72b0b33287967715db75ccbdd6d156bfeb649384f5a/f) of a transaction involving Dexlyn\'s Ethereum bridge. \\n\\nOn Supra L1 side, the fee was US$0.000. Affordable, right?\\n\\n![StarKey - SupraScan tx fee](/img/blog/2025-02-09_06_supra_l1_tx_fee.png)\\n\\nAs you can see the exact amount is 0.001001 SUPRA (**$0.00001742**). Transaction fees will go up as L1 gets more busy, but even if they go up 10 times, it\'ll still be cheap! Did I mention that transactions complete in low single digit seconds? \\n\\nWhat else should you know?\\n\\nYour StarKey WXX can be sent to any wallet that supports it, and private key of the address can be exported if you want to simply import the address to another wallet.\\n\\nFor Dexlyn\'s DEX, they have instructions how to fund dexUSDC by sending USDC (ERC-20) to their bridge. \\n\\nThe only thing missing is dexWXX-dexUSDC pair and the correspoinding Liquidity Pool.\\n\\n:::info\\nIf you want to stay up-to-date, follow Dexlyn and Aptos on X.\\n\\n- Dexlyn: https://dexlyn.com/\\n- Aptos: https://aptos.dev/\\n\\nNext key step for Delxyn - in the context of this post - is to add support for arbitrary DIY pairs and pools. To trade WXX on Dexlyn DEX we\'d need to wrap it, and trade `dexWXX/dexUSDC`.\\n\\nFor Aptos, it\'s to launch.\\n:::\\n\\nLater on when arbitrary pairs become available, we should be able to wrap WXX on Supra into something like `dexWXX` and trade/swap/send/receive natively on Supra L1.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn a week or so EVM will be available on Supra testnet. \\n\\nTechnically savvy folks could take the WXX contract (published by the XX Foundation) and release `$SXX` (Supra-wrapped XX on Supra L1) on Supra testnet. \\n:::\\n\\n### xx coin and Supra ecosystem\\n\\nSupra is just getting started. It\'s 10 weeks old.\\n\\nWhat\'s coming soon is:\\n\\n- Native EVM support (the flagship language is Move, and MoveVM is the first VM supported since TGE), which means the Ethereum Smart Contract used to issue WXX could be issued on Supra L1 without using Ethereum L1\\n- Bridgeless (yes, bridgeless) cross-chain swapping on Supra. When a Substate chain (probably Polkadot or Kusama) becomes supported, xx Network could be supported as well, but xx Network would have to update chain to support latest and greatest Substrate SDK features\\n\\nEither of these would be a huge improvement over WXX.\\n\\nIn the first case, with an `SdexXX` (assuming this be the name of a xx ERC-20 token created on Supra L1 using the same contract that was used for WXX) it would take seconds to exit to native xx tokens. And it\'d cost almost nothing. Sound good?\\n\\nIn the second case, `WXX` would become redundant and xx Network wouldn\'t even *need* a bridge. \\n\\n#### SupraNS\\n\\nAnother interesting thing is SupraNS, the official Supra name system, i.e. \\"Supra\'s ENS\\". It\'s [here](https://suprans.id/names) and requires Supra tokens to register. It\'s much cheaper than ENS, which is great, but because it just launched there\'s no wallet that supports it.\\n\\n:::info\\nStarKey will likely be the first to support SupraNS. \\n:::\\n\\nWith SupraNS support in StarKey it will be easier to send tokens to Supra wallet.\\n\\nLater on, when SupraNS allows for more entries (such as URLs and maybe arbitrary fields), we may be able to add things like nicknames from xx Network Haven (the reference quantum-resistant messaging app).\\n\\n## How to buy Supra\\n\\n:::note\\nThis is not a recommendation or advice. \\n\\nIf you don\'t want to use Dexlyn and only want to try `WXX` in StarKey, you don\'t even need Supra. You just need `WXX` and `$ETH` for transaction fees. This will use Ethereum L1 so it won\'t be particularly interesting, exciting, fast, or cheap.\\n:::\\n\\nIf you want to play with Supra tokens, SupraNS or Dexlyn DEX, today you need just 2 dollars.\\n\\nRegistering a SupraNS name now takes 1-40 SUPRA (depending on name length) and transaction fees are low as shown above.\\n\\nIf you want to play with this stuff (e.g. SupraNS), you need to fund your StarKey with either `$USDC` (ERC-20; add it through Manage Tokens). You can use `$USDC` to swap to `dexUSDC` and/or `$SUPRA`. Or you can use just `$SUPRA`.\\n\\n- `$USDC` to `$SUPRA` - Dexlyn has instructions on how to fund `$dexUSDC` with `$USDC` over their Ethereum bridge. This is possible, but slightly complicated. I\'d just buy $SUPRA and send it to my StarKey.\\n- Supra tokens get be swapped for `dexUSDC` on Dexlyn DEX at [https://app.dexlyn.com/](https://app.dexlyn.com/)\\n- Native `$SUPRA` - buy it on MEXC (most xx users have an account there) and withdraw it to your StarKey\\n  - You can also get `$SUPRA` from Houdini, SimpleSwap, and few other CEX (see CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko)\\n\\n:::note\\nIf you want to try out existing dexUSDC-Supra Liquidity Pool, you need to stake it with more than $2, so I don\'t recommend this. \\n\\nThat\'s no longer playing, but speculating/investing or whatever you want to call it.\\n:::\\n\\nOnce you have `$SUPRA` you can register SupraNS names and buy/sell `$dexUSDC`. You can also pay for Supra L1 transaction fees.\\n\\n## HOw to buy WXX\\n\\nGet them on Uniswap or SimpleSwap.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nThat\'s not all! Supra has **quite a few** other tricks up their sleeve!

The first target is MONEYTEAM: they run more than 5 nodes, and do it in different regions. An enemy of the network.\\n\\nFirst, I find their cMix IDs in the wallet.\\n\\nThen I use the workflow from my Github repository (see Appendix A) to find their IP addresses, add them to a list and then run the script that denies them access. The script - as posted on Github - works fine with generic `ufw` settings recommended in the xx Network Handbook, so you may use it by yourself if you want.\\n\\n#### Monitoring and reporting\\n\\nThis is time consuming. I\'ve been planning, evaluating and developing an approach to gather data and produce reports.\\n\\nThis is important for several reasons, for example:\\n\\n- Nominators who potentially compromise a few percent in yield may want to know if I\'m really blocking as I say I do.\\n- I need to know if I\\"m realy blocking (as I can\'t claim I am if I\'m not) and how well.\\n- I need the data to see how effective my approach is, and to estimate losses caused to the pools.\\n\\nSo far I got monitoring working in a prototype. That means it\'s not \\"automated\\", but the steps work.\\n\\nToday I deployed the rules to `ARMAIRANCAP-ALFA` targeting MONEYTEAM as I\'ve mentioned earlier. \\n\\nI have a report generator that lists cMix rounds failed due to timeouts in last 24 hours.\\n\\n![MONEYTEAM blocking PoC](/img/blog/2025-01-27-blocking-poc-moneyteam-alfa-01.png)\\n\\n:::info\\nThat\'s actually from yesterday - an accidental timeout (before I started blocking) - but I can\'t tell which round failed to my blocking and which to other reasons. \\n\\nMy report looks for specific (pool cMix IDs stored in a DB), so this doesn\'t list rounds that failed with random nodes.\\n:::\\n\\nThe second table shows total damage to the pool (see Appendix B). You can see there\'s a lot more failed rounds today (Jan 27) after 4am UTC and that `eXRzev8PC/OXj669SLGwy2zQmr6p8uCmPy0oF03AfiwC` got hit the hardest, 4 failed cMix rounds.\\n\\nLet\'s see that first round, 317854252, in the Dashboard.\\n\\n![MONEYTEAM blocking PoC - round 317854252](/img/blog/2025-01-27-blocking-poc-moneyteam-alfa-02.png)\\n\\nIf we pick the last round from the first table - [318132140](https://dashboard.xx.network/rounds/318132140) - we can see that\'s cMix ID `itrNbIlTQwJfD4SKB6dCQM/qJOpblYZzXgMp10QGKWgC` which is a wallet with on-chain ID `moneyteam_06` running out of the UK (see Appendix B).\\n\\n![MONEYTEAM blocking PoC - round 318132140](/img/blog/2025-01-27-blocking-poc-moneyteam-alfa-03.png)\\n\\nThis is just over a 7 hour period and from only one of my nodes!\\n\\n![Nod of Approval animated GIF](/img/blog/nod-of-approval.gif)\\n\\nI hope this is as motivating to my nominators as it is to me!\\n\\n## Analysis \\n\\nBased on this small sample, let us assume 170 points gets taken away from them every eight hours. That\'s close to 500 per day, and 1,000 per day if both ALFA and CHARLIE be blocking.\\n\\n:::note\\nI plan to add additional nodes. Sorry, but I\'m not sorry!\\n:::\\n\\nIf I get to 2,000 points per day, with this I could deplete MONEYTEAM\'s earnings by 60,0000 per month. That should dent their earnings (and mine, but that\'s fine) by 3-4%.\\n\\nIn theory nothing prevents me from running 6 or 8 nodes, but for that I\'d have to not lose money running them. \\n\\nThat\'s why I need analytics, to help me scale to as many nodes as possible, while still being able to cover expenses and attract nominators.\\n\\n:::warning\\nI can start blocking CRYPTOCALIBUR today, but there\'s no way to earn 10% for validators if I\'m blocking 30 nodes. \\n\\nSo I can\'t \\"really\\" start blocking them now - I\'d lose nominators, and then my nodes wouldn\'t get elected, and then everything would be in vain.\\n:::\\n\\nThe good news here is they can\'t beat me. We both lose cMix points, but **I don\'t have to make a profit for myself and - as pool operators - they do**. \\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nThis week I\'ll start blocking MONEYTEAM from CHARLIE as well.\\n\\nI need to do more work building out monitoring, observability and reporting. \\n\\n:::info\\nAs one of many examples, that\'s obvious here - see how in Appendix B I have on-chain ID and pre-comp failure rate in a text file. That should be pulled dynamically from on-chain and dashboard, but it all takes time... \\n\\nI don\'t even want to automate all that, but just copying cMix IDs, wallet IDs and on-chain IDs, and keeping it up to date takes a lot of time.\\n:::\\n\\nOnce I reach the minimum level of monitoring,reporting and automation, I may add additional validator nodes and start blocking MONEYTEAM from those nodes as well. \\n\\nFinally, I plan to provide a Web site where my nominators and other friends of xx Network can view these statistics in near real-time.

Their IPs will be published in a Github repository together with instructions on how those who may be interested can block and unblock such nodes on their node and. This will also serve as my main transparency tool for ethical nominators.\\n\\n:::info\\nUpdate: \\nI\'ve checked and concluded it\'s not advisable to publish IPs, so the repository will start with on-chain node names and cMix IDs. See Updates below for repository information.\\n:::\\n\\nThen blocking will be introduced and I\'ll find an apropriate level of validator commission for my node.\\n\\nFinally, the node will have its on-chain identity and link to this blog published and unblock nominations.\\n\\nDepending on nominations (or a lack thereof), I may nominate the second node myself.\\n\\n## Economics\\n\\nIdeally I will block as many pool nodes as possible while staying at ~15% yield, but if I cannot block all of them I\'ll block as many as I can while making the pool nomination-worthy.\\n\\nThe idea is to grow the pool rather than block all pools right away. With just one or two validators, you can\'t block 50 validators and expect to be nomination-worthy. But I can have a low commission (say, 5%), block 10 validators, and remain commission worthy, and grow to more nodes which can then block more pool members.\\n\\nAfter deducting my expenses, all earnigns will be unbound and sold at market price so that I can fund as many nodes as possible for as long as the community allows pools to operate (including my own). I\'ve never sold xx coins I earned (which is why I have enough to nominate nodes on my own), but I can\'t scale the pool without funding its operations. \\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe xx Network community is dominated by a cohort of \\"Marxxists\\" and a Validator Industrial Complex, so ethical community members have to find a way to stop them.\\n\\nI\'ll post small updates on the first node below, and a new post once there\'s some progress regarding next steps above.\\n\\nFollow me on [X](https://x.com/armchairancap) or revisit this blog for updates on this matter.\\n\\n## Appendix A - Updates\\n\\n### Update 1\\n\\nI encountered minor problems (firewall, of course) and it took me 30 minutes to start, but the node is performing well. \\n\\nAdditional nodes may be deployed sooner than expected.

I\'ll refer to it as Plan A.\\n\\nI\'m pleased to report that zero (0) people joined my attempt to execute Plan A. (Just as expected, I might add - it\'s not that different from Polkadot governance issues described above.)\\n\\nThis is about my next attempt and this time I\'ll do it myself because both those who are paid to do something about it and xx Network governance have failed me.\\n\\n## Plan B vs Plan A\\n\\nWith Plan A, I tried to fund others to block IPs of pool nodes. That was actually a great plan, but the community sucks and/or is disengaged.\\n\\nWith Plan B, I\'m just going to do it myself. The idea is the same: annoy and economically hurt centralizing sock-puppet node farmers. To do that, I need to build a farm of blocking validator nodes.\\n\\n## Success criteria\\n\\nI won\'t have enough nodes to make a big impact, so the effects of this won\'t be significant.\\n\\n:::note\\nThis is one of the reasons Plan A was great - it seeked to pay other validators who already have validator nodes ready.\\n\\nIf the Foundation had any sense, they would have not just rejected pools, but also fund a validator compensation program to pay everyone to execute Plan A on their behalf.\\n:::\\n\\nBut I also don\'t *need* to make a big impact. It\'s enough to get noticed, so that is key: get noticed and raise awareness about the problem.\\n\\nIf I make some pool runners give up or change node names to \\"hide\\" them, that would be even better.\\n\\nBlocking and annoying centralizing pools can\'t *fix* the problem: the moment I stop doing this, they\'ll start coming back. It has to be fixed through the currently failing governance and the Foundation.\\n\\nI don\'t run either of those, so all I can do is make noise about outside the community, because inside I\'ve already tried and failed.\\n\\nI may run this experiment for weeks or months, depending on how I feel about it.\\n\\n## How it\'s going to work\\n\\n- I will stand up one or more validator node(s)\\n- Validator commission will be low (I don\'t know how low, but likely single-digit)\\n- Validator nodes will block all **obvious** pool members (`MONEYTEAM`, etc.) so that they fail cMix rounds where my pool nodes participate\\n- (TBD) Block all **non-obvious** pools. It takes time and effort to find them, so this is a low-priority item now. I\'ll go for the low-hanging fruit first.\\n\\nNow, one node out of 370 won\'t matter. At most it will result in slightly more failed rounds (in pre-comp stage, for now at least) than normal and be barely noticeable.\\n\\nBut if I get to four active nodes, that\'s more than one percent of all validators and may become annoying to poo runners. Whether or not I\'ll get there depends on how many nominations I can get.\\n\\nEight nodes would be great, but that needs 1.7 MXX so it\'s harder to achieve. It may be possible if I target just one of the obvious pools (rather than all).\\n\\n:::info\\nThe new node(s) will have the on-chain ID `ARMCHAIRANCAP/{NODE_NAME}` and be nominated by `ARMCHAIRANCAP` and/or its proxy wallet `ARMCHAIRANCAP/ArmchairAncap-Proxy-Wallet` (`6VMBPjeLHTM5qerw2zJCHs9t3VyeChf2MiE35MesLRxkb1wW`).\\n\\nIf I make any changes, I\'ll update this information.\\n:::\\n\\n### Process\\n\\nI will first stand up one node and run it for an era or two to calibrate it (see how much it earns, etc.).\\n\\nThen I\'ll start blocking pools, observe my own earnings, the blocked pools\' earnings and adjust my validator commission so that I can break even on hosting costs.\\n\\nI figure that if my nodes fail 25% of all rounds I could break even. Obviously:\\n\\n- My oppportunity cost is the loss of profits which I would make by normally validating and nominating\\n- I can\'t have 16 nodes that do that because I can\'t nominate 16 nodes on my own (that would take close to 3 MXX in nominations)\\n- Even with a very low comission, my nodes may not yield enough to compensate for failed rounds, so I I may or may not attract other nominators\\n- Because there won\'t be much (or any) profit, I\'ll sell all earnings the day they\'re made to pay for hosting\\n\\nIf my node(s) profit rate for nominators be very low (e.g. 8% APR), then they\'re unlikely to attract any nominators used to 16% or even higher APR. \\n\\nMaybe I\'ll get to two or four or more nodes, but it\'s not likely.\\n\\n## Participation\\n\\nIn Plan A, I wanted to pay people to block pools. That didn\'t work, but I\'ll be checking my [chat space](/xx-directory#armchairancaps-channels) every now and then, to see if anyone wants to reach out.\\n\\nSpace participants may be asked to [sign their Haven handle](/blog/2024/11/28/xx-validators-shall-we-play-a-game#how-to-sign-your-wallet-address) using their address in xx Network wallet, so that I don\'t have to guess how many XX tokens you have or if you really are a validator.\\n\\n:::note\\nWhy do I need to know how many tokens you have?\\n\\nI actually don\'t care, but if you feel the need to discuss something from a validator or nominator perspective, I\'ll probably ask you to sign your Haven identify from your wallet, so that we can see if you\'re actually who you are or just an airdrop guy with 147.2753 XX in your wallet.\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s what I\'m interested in:\\n\\n- Prospective nominators (especially with 1 MXX or more) which would allow me to run 8 or more nodes\\n- Help with identifying non-obvious pool runners\\n- Validators and nominators interested in discussing ideas for fixing this problem\\n\\n## Ethics of blocking (and not)\\n\\n- Is it ethical to block pools? Absolutely! They have a negative effect on the security of the network.\\n\\n- All validators should run less nodes than a cMix round has, which is five. If I get enough nominations, should I run more than four nodes? I think as long as it is obvious that *others* do it without declaring it (run more than 4 nodes, that is), there\'s no harm in me doing it transparently and with the sole purpose of stopping it. At any rate, I\'d like to know what arguments those who don\'t think centralized pools are bad may have against my pool.\\n\\n- Is it ethical that the Foundation and the Technical Committee are not addressing this problem? I would say not, especially when it comes to *paid* officers of the Foundation.\\n\\n## Will it work?\\n\\nIt doesn\'t matter. To me, the question is \\"should I try?\\" and the answer is \\"of course!\\"\\n\\nThat said, if it doesn\'t work out, this is probably the last thing I\'ll try before I become a \\"passive supporter\\" and move on to participating in functioning communities. I don\'t *have* to be here!\\n\\nThe Foundation, the Technical Committee and xx coin holders have the right and responsibility to manage the network. The Foundation should actively fight pools and use any means necessary to ban all wallets that belong to individuals with five or more nodes. Sadly, they\'re not doing it. (I would be less surprised if they banned my pool and I don\'t mind - that would bring my experiment to conclusion sooner.)\\n\\nDepending on how this turns out (I don\'t mean \\"whether I find any nominators\\", but whether this issue gets addressed by the DAO or the Foundation) this may be the last thing I will do for the project with own money and time."},{"id":"2025/01/04/xx-network-initial-validator-list-for-due-dilligence","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/01/04/xx-network-initial-validator-list-for-due-dilligence","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-04-xx-network-initial-validator-list-for-due-dilligence.md","title":"First pass of nomination-worthy xx Network validators (2025/01/04)","description":"Potentially nomination-worthy xx Network validators as of early 2025","date":"2025-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"}],"readingTime":14.67,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025/01/04/xx-network-initial-validator-list-for-due-dilligence","title":"First pass of nomination-worthy xx Network validators (2025/01/04)","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain"],"description":"Potentially nomination-worthy xx Network validators as of early 2025","keywords":["xx network","economics","validator","stake","nominating","recommendation"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-01-04-xx-chain-era-1144-waiting.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"An attempt to address validator centralization problem","permalink":"/blog/2025/01/06/xx-network-armchairancap-pool"},"nextItem":{"title":"Notes before the change of minimum validator stake on xx Chain","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/31/xx-network-minimum-validator-stake-change"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [Update on validator doom](#update-on-validator-doom)\\n- [First pass](#first-pass)\\n- [Notes](#notes)\\n  - [Example for `4CRYPTO`](#example-for-4crypto)\\n  - [Possible improvements and take-aways](#possible-improvements-and-take-aways)\\n- [Appendix A - potentially nomination-worthy validators as of 2025/04/01](#appendix-a---potentially-nomination-worthy-validators-as-of-20250401)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI\'m not entirely convinced I should spend my time on this given the community of xx Network, but for what it\'s worth here\'s an improved list of potentially nomination-worthy xx Network validators as of January 4, 2025.\\n\\nCompared to the lists of \\"known shit\\" and \\"potentially OK\\" nodes given in [the previous post](/blog/2024/12/31/xx-network-minimum-validator-stake-change), this list improves on one minor shortcoming (mentioned in that past) which is that in that post I dropped nodes without at least 5 active nominators.\\n\\n:::tip\\nActive nominators are those nominating a node in current era (day). \\n\\nInactive nominators seem to be **all** nominators (not just inactive, but both inactive and active!) nominating a node. If I\'m wrong, then inactive plus active would be \\"all\\" nominators. \\n:::\\n\\nThat meant that a validator with 50 nominators who get nominated by just 4 (active) nominators in this era, and be dropped from the list. Now I consider inactive nominators and look for at least five.\\n\\n## Update on validator doom\\n\\nAlso already commented on in the previous post is the community doomers\' prediction about \\"validator exodus\\" that was going to happen due to the still pathetically small new minimum validator stake of 15,000 XX (only $750-ish now). \\n\\nToday there\'s more validators in waiting than there\'s been in many weeks - 26.\\n\\n![26 validators in waiting](/img/blog/2025-01-04-xx-chain-era-1144-waiting.png)\\n\\nNot only there\'s no shortage of validators (although the slots *should* be cut to improve the quality and kick out the pools), but there\'s more validators than we had in December and the network is also more secure.\\n\\nThe stupidity of those community members has no limits! (Normally I\'d say \\"ignorance\\", but you can check the forum - it was explained over and over again, on top of the fact that it shouldn\'t need to be explained in the first place!)\\n\\n## First pass\\n\\nHere\'s the first update in 2025.\\n\\n:::note\\nThis table does **not** container the list of recommended validators. It\'s just a starting point.\\n:::\\n\\nI exclude:\\n\\n- Names from my black list - any on-chain wallet IDs that pools use to identify themselves (`CRYPTOCALIBUR` and others)\\n- Anyone without on-chain ID - easy way to eliminate pool trash\\n- Anyone with the validator stake below the new minimum (15,000 XX that took effect 3 eras ago) - to avoid unexpected dropouts and avoid stranding\\n- Anyone with less than 2 active or less than 5 inactive (`Nom (I)`) nominators - to avoid stranding your nominations\\n- Anyone who takes more than 22.00% from node rewards\\n- Any nodes whose predicted stake is or was more than 400,000 XX (i.e., \\"a lot\\")\\n\\n:::info\\nMany nodes - both with and without on-chain ID - are controlled by hostile node runners who run the same or greater number of nodes than cMixx group size (five), adding risk to network.\\nThose farm runners *usually*, but not always, have all of their nodes located in the same \\"geobin\\" i.e. a country or a region. If possible, avoid nominating more than 3 nodes from the same continent.\\n\\nNodes in Waiting - are excluded by default as a precaution, because Waiting is generally a high-risk area and may not be easy to safely \\"automate\\" recommendations (if anyone\'s nomination-worthy, why aren\'t they currently elected?). If you want to \\"hunt\\" for good opportunities there, you may manually inspect them.\\n:::\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nGo to [Staking -> Overview](https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking) or  [Staking -> Targets](https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking/targets) as well as the [xx Network Explorer](https://explorer.xx.network) to perform additional checks.\\n\\n### Example for `4CRYPTO`\\n\\nIt\'s the first on the list, so I\'ll take that one as an example.\\n\\n- Decent own stake (48K XX), reasonably low commission\\n- Its [stats](https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking/query/6XweaVvZaXVagrLZtay78C6ieQRS9h6koud8CUd2gXP1BQH8) currently show consistent performance, steady and not excessive total nomination amount, no commission scamming (consistent 14%), which is all good\\n- In Staking Targets, we see the node has 55 inactive nominators, which is great. Active are just two, but that\'s because both happen to be whale nominators\\n- In the [xx Network explorer](https://explorer.xx.network/accounts/6XweaVvZaXVagrLZtay78C6ieQRS9h6koud8CUd2gXP1BQH8) we can go to `Blockchain -> Transfers` and see the node was \\"seeded\\" 1-2 years ago by probably laundering xx coins through MEXC, so it may be owned by an early validator (good) who\'s running a node farm (which would be bad, if the same person controls more than four)\\n- Also in the explorer (`Validator -> Metrics`) it says on-chain identity is bad (there\'s just wallet name and nothing else)\\n\\nNow, we could dig around to find more about those transactions, but at least it\'s not brazen like the trash from CRYPTOCALIBUR and MONEYTEAM, for example. \\n\\nIf you can find better nodes, choose better nodes. If not, this one may do - it\'s less bad than the nodes without on-chain ID and outright pool trash.\\n\\n### Possible improvements and take-aways\\n\\nI may make additional improvements such as:\\n\\n- consider points from last 7 eras\\n- eliminate nodes with higher than 30% commission in any of most recent 180 eras\\n- implement finer evaluation of on-chain ID (not just a binary Yes|No, but more similar to how Explorer rates validators in its metrics - maybe something like a scale from 1 to 5)\\n- look into each nominator (wallet size, on-chain ID, number of nodes nominated by the validator...)\\n\\nEven without those improvements, it\'s obvious that only 100 or so validators are worth nominating. Or, said differently, there are close to 200 that are not (this figure includes self-sufficient validators which aren\'t necessary malicious, but from a *nominator\'s* perspective, if a node runner is self-staked to 400,000 XX and takes a 40% commission, they\'re *not nomination-worthy*). \\n\\nConsidering this situation , it\'s not even feasible to make improvements to this node selection script - we\'d have to drop even more nodes and having 50-60 nomination-worthy nodes out of 370 would be catastrophic: one would have to either crowd on the few good validators or nominate malicious (or generally not nomination-worthy) validators. Either of these choices is bad for the network.\\n\\nBecause of that I don\'t think I\'ll even consider publishing an updated list until the community does something to clean up that mess.\\n\\n##

[Appendix B - potentially problematic nodes](#appendix-b---potentially-problematic-nodes)\\n\\n## What changed, how and why\\n\\nThose who follow xx Network are likely aware of the [changes](https://forum.xx.network/t/revised-increase-min-staking/7045) to the minimum validator stake.\\n\\nUntil era 1140 (today), validators could start validating with only 1,000 XX (less than $50).\\n\\nThe intent to introduce changes and \\"return\\" to the old limit were first approved in a referendum, and then a separate democracy vote approved the same change to chain variables deployed as a scheduled task set to increase the minimum stake to 15,000 XX on January 1, 2025. The first referendum also approves additional hikes in 2025 as necessary.\\n\\nThe minimum used to be 14,0000 XX back in 2021 when XX token was worth 4-5 times as much.\\n\\nWhy was it reduced to 1,000 XX? Because several loud community members who don\'t know anything about economics made more noise than the rest.\\n\\nWith the new hike the minimum stake is slightly higher, but only in XX coins. In US dollars, it\'s still almost 80% lower than the already low stake that the network used to have before.\\n\\n## Why is 15K better than 1K\\n\\nBecause xx Network is as Proof of Stake network.\\n\\nValidators must have a lot at stake to demonstrate their commitment to good, secure validation. It\'s nothing new.\\n\\nThe new minimum stake will make it harder (more expensive) to scam nominators. Starting with tomorrow\'s era it will cost 15 times as much to stand up a bunch of nodes, wait until they\'re nominated and elected, and then hike commission from the initial \\"below 20%\\" standard to 30% or 40% until nominators figure it out. Once they do, you spin up a new node with just $50 on it and start again.\\n\\nIt will also make node hoarding more expensive. You can still run a 20 node validator farm and undermine the security of the network, but for new adversaries that becomes 15 times more expensive.\\n\\nThe hike doesn\'t \\"solve\\" either of these problems, but it makes such behavior more expensive.\\n\\n## What now\\n\\nSome of the same xx community ignoramuses claim 15,000 XX is already unbearable for the \\"poor validators\\" who haven\'t been making profits from validation and now won\'t be able to afford 14,000 XX to be able to continue validating.\\n\\nFirst, that\'s false, because they can keep going as long as they don\'t stop validating.\\n\\nSecond, if validating is not sustainable, compromising security of the network to inflate participation (and create more money-losing validators) isn\'t a good way to fix that problem.\\n\\nTomorrow\'s Phragmen election will be the first one which will prevent new entrants, but all the existing ones will be able to continue with their sub-15K XX stake.\\n\\nOf course, the scammers have their little VM-based nodes ready to go: among the 24 nodes currently in Waiting only three seem regulars. I checked each prospective validator\'s wallet: all but three had 1,010 XX or less staked!\\n\\nWaiting area during era 1140 (top):\\n\\n![Waiting validators in era 1140 - screenshot 1](/img/blog/2024-12-31-xx-chain-era-1140-waiting-01.png)\\n\\nWaiting area (bottom):\\n\\n![Waiting validators in era 1140 - screenshot 2](/img/blog/2024-12-31-xx-chain-era-1140-waiting-02.png)\\n\\nAs they\'ve already started validating but haven\'t been elected, I guess they may not be electable. Since they have no sizable nominators, I doubt any of those 21 can be elected anyway.\\n\\n## What else needs to be done\\n\\nxx Network suffers from the price of the token which makes validation unprofitable. That cannot (or at least: should not) be fixed by compromising the security of the network.\\n\\nBut the community is disengaged (I wrote about the same problem seen in other DAOs [such as Polkadot](/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks)) and 90% of active community members are either \\"degens\\" (price-focused speculators) or economic ignoramuses, which makes any improvements difficult.\\n\\nThe xx Foundation and Technical Committee members are staying out of these (seemingly \\"non-fundamental\\") governance discussions which is appropriate, but the end result is not satisfactory because meaningful improvements cannot happen in such environment. And more needs to be done.\\n\\nValidator slots should be shrunk, but the groups I mentioned are against because it\'s (supposedly) \\"bad PR\\". By that logic adding 10 more slots should help (after all, there\'s as many as 24 nodes in waiting!), but they don\'t suggest that. I wonder why that is.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\n:::note\\n15,000 XX is a laughable minimum validator stake ($750).\\n\\nIt takes much more on other Substrate networks and [$10,000](/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily#opinion-on-cell) to validate on Cellframe.\\n\\nKeep that in mind before you start \\"proving\\" that a node owner with $750 staked on the node has more at staken than a node owner with $10,000 stakend on the node.\\n:::\\n\\nAs we are about to enter era 1141, the hike seems entirely justified and obviously helpful - it doesn\'t need to \\"solve\\" anything, it just needs to make the undermining of security more expensive, which it does by a factor of 15.\\n\\nIn other words, this remains possible but now costs 15 times more, which is great.\\n\\n![Stealth theft by validators](/img/blog/2024-12-31-xx-chain-era-1140-waiting-03.png)\\n\\n## What else should be done?\\n\\n- Validator slots should be cut by 10 or 20 slots to ensure nodes require at least 300 K XX to get elected. Now a handful of nodes has less than 100 K XX (probably due to the pool scammers reshuffling those nodes which dropped), although more recently it was around 225 K XX. The network didn\'t need 370 nodes in the first place and they shouldn\'t have been added, so there should be no second thoughts about making necessary reductions and yet here we are, with dozens of people running many nodes with 1K XX validator stake on each...\\n- An xx Postage bounty should be created and released as soon as ongoing bounties are delivered, to ensure real demand for tokens in second half of 2025. A RFC is on the forum and just needs to be worked on and released.\\n- Various governance improvements are necessary\\n\\nGovernance needs to be improved to create more engagement both internally (validators, nominators), but also externally (with builders). That is mostly happening because of this stalemate between a disengaged majority, a loud (but grossly incompetent) minority of validators, and an unopinionated Foundation. I hope this will be resolved and improved in 2025.\\n\\n## Update for era 1141\\n\\n- Just two (non-scammers) from the Waiting list got elected. As I\'ve said above, I\'m not sure if the scammers were even considered, given their non-elected status and a sub-15 K XX validator stake.\\n- The next question is how many validators are still running with a sub-15K XX stake and do not have other problems? The answer to this question is: not many. These are nodes that don\'t have the validator stake of 15,000 XX or higher:\\n  - No on-chain ID: these are often pools or soft-scammers (see the pattern above) who don\'t care about validator reputation\\n  - Too few nominators (may be high risk, although in some cases you\'ll find an old-timer who is self-sufficient nd doesn\'t have 3rd party nominators). These can easily move tokens from the nomination to the validation wallet and get compliant instantly (i.e. buy 15K XX on MEXC and withdraw to validator wallet and in parallel unbond 15K from nominator wallet and later sell that on MEXC)\\n  - High commission (scammers and self-stakers) - not worth nominating (scammers) or don\'t need nominators because they\'re sufficient (self-stakers, sometimes also pools)\\n  - High nominator stake (example: `6ZNPt8\u2026i17kW8` at the very top, over 1 MXX) - not worth nominating, don\'t need nominators and obviously loaded in any case\\n\\nThis list shows all nodes with \\"validator stake problem\\" active in era 1140 (most have other problems, too):\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at several examples of nodes that look legit (no other challenges or reasons), but don\'t have enough staked by the validator. That is, on the surface their only problem is a low own stake. I\'ll review such nodes from only the last 20 lines (for easier viewing from this position):\\n\\n- `MONEYTEAM_` - pool trash (there are others, such as `UNITED EARTH`) - getting rid of them would be a blessing!\\n- `NARAYANA SUPRAMATI` - multi-year validator who scored well over 100 K XX in the Foundation sponsorship and probably has enough funds to run multiple nodes (e.g. [VANILLA](https://explorer.xx.network/accounts/6Wf5dmk8d268ucXc7qqEd9qu2NwifxwnMefmMZu9dD9f9V92)). This guy is far from tapping out - he\'ll be fine!\\n- `DIPRO` - the same with regard to the Foundation sponsorship.\\n- `6aug5i\u2026kz3J21` - the same with regard to the Foundation sponsorship. Also, has a relatively high commission (22%) for such a low-earning node (barely earns 140 XX per era - probably just an undersized VM). Been around for almost 1,000 eras, but too busy to set an on-chain ID or set node commission to levels commersurate with the el cheapo VM it\'s running on.\\n- `6X83J3\u2026FNvajd` - hasn\'t done a single cMixx round in last 30 days. Why is this guy even elected?\\n- `BLOCKBARD` - Just $50 short of the new minimum. He\'s been around for a while and doesn\'t pay for the node from earnings (since none are being sent to an exchange)\\n- All others from the last 20 lines have other problems or don\'t need nominators (e.g. self-nominated such as 6ZvBHA\u2026DgpQSp).\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is true that many nodes don\'t have the minimum validator stake, but the validators above aren\'t the only ones I\'ve looked at and I\'m yet to find that mythical \\"honest struggling validator\\". If you can\'t be bothered to set an on-chain ID (not to mention other, more meaningful things), run at 22% commission earning 140 XX per day, etc. it\'s hard to be taken seriously and expect sympathy.\\n\\n## Appendix A - initial validator set for due diligence\\n\\nThese aren\'t recommended, but merely meet some basic criteria:\\n\\n- 22.00% or lower validator commission rate\\n- more than 15K XX minimum stake\\n- more than 35,000 cMix points (in era 1140, in this case)\\n- obvious pool members have been pre-dropped, but many need to be manually checked\\n\\n:::tip\\nIdeally we\'d check for more than 35,000 cMix points and lower than 22% commission in 180 most recent eras, for example.\\n:::\\n\\nFrom the below list I\'d drop the following before doing other checks:\\n\\n- nodes without an on-chain ID\\n- nodes without at least 90 eras of successful validation at below 22% commission\\n- pool trash (the obvious ones have been dropped from the table below, but there may be others)\\n\\n```raw\\n+---------------------------+-------------+----------+-------------+--------------+---------------+--------------+\\n| Name                      | cMix ID     |    Stake |

a priori excluded, but are suspicious.\\n\\n- high commission\\n- pool trash (CRYPTOCALIBUR, MONEYTEAM, UNITED EARTH, etc.) and non-mixing nodes (XX FOUNDATION are Foundation nodes that always get elected, but don\'t run cMixx)\\n- too few or too many nominators (but see Note below)\\n- low own stake (could stop validating, become unelectable, and leave your nomination inactive)\\n- high nomination value (which means a lower ROI)\\n- no on-chain ID (potential scammers, pool drones)\\n\\n:::note\\n\\"Too few\\" nominators isn\'t a sure sign of a problem because that figure is the number of \\"staking nominators in current era\\" whereas the node may have more nominators but not assigned by Phragmen in this era. That would require additional checks. A self-sufficient runner (e.g. ANODE2 self-staked with 500 K XX) may have no nominators for obvious and perfectly legitimate reasons.\\n:::\\n\\n```raw\\n+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Name

[Transactions](#transactions)\\n- [Tips for degens](#tips-for-degens)\\n- [Why is this cool?](#why-is-this-cool)\\n- [Next steps](#next-steps)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe idea is to crowdsource funds for a CrowdSwap liquidity pool for WXX (BRC20), which is a wrapped WXX (ERC20), which itself is wrapped XX on Ethereum. \\n\\nSince BNB and Ethereum are similar, re-wrapping [WXX (ERC20)](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/ethereum/0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2) - issued by the xx Foundation - is secure and easy.\\n\\nNow some of the WXX (ERC20) that\'s available on Uniswap will be re-wrapped as WXX (BRC20), as I understand it, making it easy to move liquidity between DEXes. Pancake swap will be added later.\\n\\nRead about it [here](https://xx.network/blog/crowdswap/). \\n\\n:::warning\\n- If you\'re a US citizen, US resident or from a weird country, don\'t even try (there\'s KYC)\\n- Payment can be done today or on February 23, but \\"delivery\\" will happen after (February 25?) (see the link above)\\n\\nThis is not a recommendation or advice. Do your own research.\\n:::\\n\\nThe sale ends on February 24, 2025.\\n\\n## Why buy WXX(BRC20)\\n\\nMy interest here is simple:\\n\\n- I\'m a believer in DEX\\n- xx token hasn\'t been able to get listed at large centralized exchanges because its privacy options make it look fishy (as if it\'s a privacy coin, which it is not)\\n- Historically DEXes have had a problem with liquidity. Newest one don\'t, but these still do, so they need help\\n- There are rewards (funded by xx Foundation), so it\'s not just free donation of liquidity - there are benefits for those who participate to help with liquidity of decentralized XX markets\\n\\n## Buying process\\n\\nRead the link above for the details, but ignoring the conditions (very important, so you need to read the link), the \\"doing\\" part goes like this:\\n\\n- You need at least the equivalent of $105 or so in crypto, as the minimum purchase is $100 and there are other fees involved\\n- Pick a wallet which can work with https://app.crowdswap.org and connect it\\n- In user profile, fill in a name, email, and pick username for Crowdswap (I think that\'s mostly for referrals, there\'s no login or password)\\n- Find the xx private sale for WXX on **Opportunity** page\\n- You need to agree and \\"sign\\" an agreement to be able to actually perform a transaction\\n- If you\'re not in one of trouble countries, a simple KYC may be necessary (for me it was very a painless process, but it may depend on your IP or who knows what)\\n\\n### Transactions\\n\\nMetamask was a frustrating experience for UDST (I could have used Ethereum, but I didn\'t want to pay their gas fees), so I gave up and used BNB chain in another wallet. \\n\\n:::tip\\nThe easiest way is to send ETH or BNB to a native ETH or BNB address wallet, and buy with that. \\n\\nIf you\'re looking for cheapest fees, maybe try sending USDT(BNB) or BNB tokens to a BNB wallet. \\n\\nI don\'t know what networks are supported, so I can\'t really tell for sure. Please check on your own and test with a small transaction before you send $100 or more.\\n:::\\n\\nI screwed up at first - I sent USDT to a BNB wallet, but didn\'t have any native coins to do anything that, so I also had to send some dust for the gas. Stupid... \\n\\nOnce that was solved, and all the steps from the list above done, I was able to pay:\\n\\n![USDT on BNB](/img/blog/2024-12-17-buying-wxx-bep20-wrapped-wxx-dex-crowdswap-coin-01.png)\\n\\nThat was close to 2000 WXX(BRC20), about the same price that one can get on MEXC (more on that later).\\n\\n:::note\\n\\"WXX\\" in this screenshot is the address tag.\\n\\nWXX(BRC20) will be paid once the private sale ends.\\n:::\\n\\nThe wallet asked for a confirmation:\\n\\n![WXX purchase completed](/img/blog/2024-12-17-buying-wxx-bep20-wrapped-wxx-dex-crowdswap-coin-02.png)\\n\\nWith that I successfully completed the first \\"test\\" transaction in this private sale!\\n\\nI paid the following transaction fees from the wallet:\\n\\n- 0.0000x BNB to sign the purchase agreement (\\"empty\\" transaction)\\n- 0.000x BNB purchase coins (USDT on BNB transferred to the seller)\\n\\nOne BNB is around $370 so it was very cheap. I don\'t know how much it\'d cost on Ethereum, but probably more.\\n\\nThe fee I paid to send USDT(BNB) and BNB tokens from a CEX to the wallet isn\'t shown, as it\'s collected at the source.\\n\\nCurrently XX/USDT at MEXC is the same as this, so there\'s no immediate financial benefit to buying, but I plan to buy more because I want to provide liquidity for the XX pairs on decentralized exchanges.\\n\\n## Tips for degens\\n\\nTo fund my purchases of WXX(BRC20) I may sell some of my \\"non-wrapped\\" XX coins. \\n\\nAs others will likely do the same, it\'s is expected that the price of XX/USDT on MEXC (the biggest XX CEX market) will remain the same as the crowdsale price.\\n\\nSo... Do not buy WXX (or XX) thinking it\'s some crazy pump & dump scheme. It\'s not.\\n\\n## Why is this cool?\\n\\n- Liquidity for decentralized XX token markets\\n- Users new to xx Network will become familiar with DEX *and* cMixx (very important, as opposed to airdrops)\\n- Affordable campaign to reach out to new users\\n- Technical simplicity (uses existing XX-to-WXX contract on Ethereum)\\n\\nDownsides:\\n\\n- As long as the sale lasts, it puts a ceiling on the price of xx token, because the sale is based on the fixed priced of xx token (I guess it had to be done that way), so MEXC and other markets will be \\"stuck\\" in a narrow range and miss the ongoing bubble. I don\'t care, but some folks do. \\n\\nI think overall it\'s a very positive development for xx token.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nThese DEXes (Uniswap, Crowdswap, and in the future Pacakeswap) lessen the need for T1/T2 CEX. \\n\\n:::note\\nNext-generation DEXes will do even more to balance power beteween crypto projects and CEXes. Keep an eye on that!\\n:::\\n\\nAs incentives and rewards are available and I\'m not looking to sell or exit XX, buying some WXX (BRC20) wasn\'t a difficult decision to make.\\n\\nI also used this opportunity as an excuse to learn about the process of buying using the minimum (US$100-ish) amount. I\'ll repeat this multiple times with larger amounts before the sale ends.\\n\\nThe price of XX (and WXX) will remain \\"stuck\\" for 2 months, but benefits are going to be higher than this small inconvenience.\\n\\nI hope in 2025 XX also makes it to a next-generation DEX (one of those that will appear on Supra, for example). Spreads will become so narrow and liquidity \\"unlimited\\"! At that big CEX listings will become uninteresting. But until then and even after then, we need choices and competition."},{"id":"2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-15-why-polkadot-governance-sucks.md","title":"Why Polkadot governance sucks","description":"No, it\'s not working exceptionally well","date":"2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"economics","permalink":"/blog/tags/economics"},{"label":"dao","permalink":"/blog/tags/dao"}],"readingTime":6.94,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks","title":"Why Polkadot governance sucks","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["economics","dao"],"description":"No, it\'s not working exceptionally well","keywords":["polkadot","democracy","xx Network"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to buy WXX(BRC20)","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/17/buying-wxx-bep20-wrapped-xx-coin"},"nextItem":{"title":"Top PQ crypto coins for 2025 (according to Altcoin Daily)","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [Symptoms](#symptoms)\\n- [Why Polkadot governance sucks?](#why-polkadot-governance-sucks)\\n- [What should Polkadot do?](#what-should-polkadot-do)\\n- [Take-away](#take-away)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI\'ll make this one short because there aren\'t many such opinions.\\n\\nPolkadot is a DAO, and has governance built-in. \\n\\nIt is actually very well done and saves a lot of time to anyone building a blockchain-based DAO - xx Network uses it as well.\\n\\nWhat, then, is the problem?\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nMy knowledge of Polkadot is somewhat limited - I haven\'t participated and used it for years. \\n\\nBut I\'ve followed it closely this year and I\'ve used Kusama, for example.\\n\\nxx Network is also a DAO and uses essentially the same stack, so there isn\'t much an xx Network user needs to learn infrastructure-wise. What is needed to understand is observation - seeing how it\'s used, what users think about it, and so on.\\n\\nBased on those observations, I\'ve noticed several symptoms:\\n\\n- Claims that \\"whale\\" projects are milking the system by (easily) getting (undeserved) funding\\n- Opinions that many DAO-funded projects suck\\n- Dissatisfaction with how the DAO \\"democracy\\" works in practice\\n- Observations on disengaged participation (example: people nominate, but don\'t vote on anything even as they login to wallet to collect rewards or transfer funds)\\n- All sorts of stupid ideas are getting traction (and possibly DAO-approved funding - this I estimate based on seeing how much traction uterrly senseless ideas get in the Polkadot community)\\n\\nDon\'t believe it?\\n\\n[This proposal proposed a bounty to fund a lawsuit](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/603?tab=call) against a [\\"notable\\"](https://dablock.com/interviews/polkadot-whale-theory-giotto-de-filippi-opengov-space-monkeys/) community member Giotto De Filippi who scammed the DAO with a fake memecoin proposal that was funded with 1 MM DOT.\\n\\nClowns...\\n\\nSadly, it didn\'t pass - probably because most of those with fat DOT wallets wouldn\'t want undue attention and similar reactions to their own proposals...\\n\\nHere\'s [another](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/proposal-to-revise-the-current-staking-system/10749/39) gem:\\n\\n> Literally every 3 days I have to vote on 20-30 new proposals. This is just so time consuming, so I just open the ICP voting webtab on a side screen, vote \u201cYES\u201d on the about 25 new proposals about every 3 days, not even read the stuff anylonger, while continuing doing other work on my main screen. \\n\\nIn other words, these are the same weaknesses that we can observe in Western democracies.\\n\\nShockingly, or perhaps not at all, some still claim the DAO is functioning \\"exceptionally well\\". I guess I\'d claim that as well if I was milking the system to my satisfaction.\\n\\nThe obvious truth is governance is not functioning well at all.\\n\\n## Why Polkadot governance sucks?\\n\\nHere\'s why:\\n\\n- the DAO destroys, rather than creates, competition [1]\\n- the DAO picks winners\\n- the DAO thereby creates losers (once a winner for is picked, all others are fxxed because unless they\'re vastly superior they stand no chance of charging for their service and their funding dries up) \\n- the DAO causes inflation with such unnecessary and excessive spending\\n- the DAO hurts the ecosystem because it retards free markets that let users vote with their (subscription) tokens. Services that would normally compete and pass their costs (plus some extra value) to users siply don\'t appear because of this more-or-less \\"winner takes all\\" system created by the DAO\\n- Everyone gets to vote, and that includes self-serving cronies, ignoramuses and people who have no idea about anything (many may be underage, although their stakes are usually (and thanfully) too low to matter)\\n\\n[1] There\'s competition in the Art of Proposals and vote marshaling, all right, just not in projects and services\\n\\nMy forked (upstream was funded by the DAO, I suppose?) project for [token-gated](/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access) access to Web3 apps is a good example. I think the idea is great and use cases many (as I explain in that blog post). If you look around, you\'ll see there have been many asks for this functionality. For example, Discord channels could be gated the same way based on one\'s holdings of tokens, assets or NFTs. Even Web2 forums could use it. \\n\\nYet, no one maintains such an app for Polkadot, and \\"small\\" Web3 sites don\'t even exist. It\'s a simple app and people funded by the DAO like to apply for $500 grants rather than smaller projects that general users could use to create a \\"no-code\\" Web3 experience or bridge Web2 apps to Web3.\\n\\nAnother example is various \\"major\\" Web sites in the Polkadot ecosystem. They\'re barely useful and often bloated (more \\"features\\" means more funds).\\n\\nAnyway, how to fix it? The same way it\'s done in Western democracies: by educating the voter, which is a centuries-long process and not something that will happen in our lifetime.\\n\\nFor a comparison, I think xx Network works better. It\'s not good enough, but it\'s not a disaster either. \\n\\nWhy is that? I think it\'s because it has better people, which is how it was bootstrapped. This isn\'t to say Polkadot has bad people, but it\'s been a while and they don\'t seem as engaged in the DAO as the original xx Network team. \\n\\nxx Network is more of a constitutional republic, while Polkadot is a democracy. Even though both use the same code, the latter is already corrupt beyond repair. The USA vs. the European Union.\\n\\n## What should Polkadot do?\\n\\nTo be honest, I don\'t know how they can get enough votes to do anything but keep destroying what the founder(s) and early volunteers built.\\n\\n:::note\\nOn that note, those who \\"volunteered\\" didn\'t do it for free. Most had interest in making `DOT` and `KSM` appreciate in value. Today\'s DAO leeches are nothing like the early volunteers.\\n\\nIf you\'re contributing only as long as they pay you, you\'re more akin to a bureaucrat or public sector worker. Not everyone is, but most are.\\n:::\\n\\nSome minor improvements can be made - for example they recently modified inflation rate, which is now less stupid. But I don\'t think majority of voters would support any proposal that significantly impacts their disproportional or undeserved benefits. It\'s like expecting public sector unions to support budget cuts.\\n\\nUsually a short-term solution - or interim solution - is to have a benevolent populist dictator. Someone like Linus Torvalds, who is liked enough to be given extra power. That\'s great as long as the person is around, and goes south quickly as soon as he gets replaced by a lesser person.\\n\\nIn addition to that being a short-term solution, at this point it the DAO can\'t even do that because there\'s no mechanism for this to happen. It\'s wrongly bootstrapped/wired.\\n\\nWhether it\'s done by a dictator or a powerful group, here\'s what I think would fix a lot of problems:\\n\\n- Burn all excess treasury funds not required for basic expenses plus some emergency reserve\\n- Eliminate funding of most projects excluding essential infrastructure (such as a bare bones blockchain explorer) and let them compete for paying customers on their own\\n- Reorganize funding so that it\'s split by categories and done only over very short term (3 to 6 months - just enough to let them do a PoC and be able to seek funding). Then modify voting so that those who support funding be mildly on the hook (use long-term conviction proportional to cost of spending they choose to support)\\n- Strengthen the role of on-chain identity to bring more transparency to decision-making and spending\\n- Extend unstaking period to months and years, so that it becomes lucrative to vote with higher conviction and divest slower\\n\\nEach of these items is impossible to happen, but even if it did, it wouldn\'t last long: cronies and ingnoramuses would start taking over again, possibly starting at the top (with someone who\'d undo everything even faster).\\n\\n## Take-away\\n\\nThe same tool used by different people can lead to a very different result.\\n\\nThe Polkadot DAO is failing, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s worse than other crypto projects. Most other projects are much worse, which is why I\'m happy to be part of the greater Polkadot ecosystem and xx Network in particular.\\n\\nReal and sustainable change requires education, which takes decades and maybe even centuries. We won\'t live long enough to see it. \\n\\nMeanwhile, those of us who care have to do what we can to slow that decline and make our projects stay around long enough until most \\"DAOists\\" learn to act in common interest."},{"id":"2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-14-top-quantum-resistant-crypto-coins-in-2025.md","title":"Top PQ crypto coins for 2025 (according to Altcoin Daily)","description":"Top PQ coins?

Fundamentally, privacy means inconvenience and extra cost (in time or hardware or software), so privacy-focused solutions are not easy to sell. \\n\\nBut now this is a topic that we are expected to have an opinion about, so let\'s take a look at what these projects are, their claims, are and *whether* they should be compared with xx Network (and if so, how).\\n\\n:::note\\n\\"Post-quantum\\" and \\"quantum-resistant\\" means unbreakable by Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) systems aka Quantum Computers. \\nSo PQC means resistant to attacks by known CRQCs.\\n:::\\n\\n## Cellframe (CELL)\\n\\nFrom their [white paper](https://cellframe.net/white-paper/):\\n\\n> By design, Cellframe\u2019s architecture is a structure with a dual-layer sharding. The first layer (heterogeneous layer) can launch customizable subchains and tokens. On the second layer (homogeneous layer), subchains are organized in Cells. Due to interoperability features we plan to build an ecosystem of services where every app (or dapp) will have an opportunity to exchange information with another app in a p2p manner.\\n\\nThis is nice, but as always, I don\'t like this rebuilding of the wheel. \\n\\nEveryone has a dApp platform... Including xx Chain (and all Substrate-based chains). Even Polkadot - a top coin - doesn\'t have enough apps (and their ecosystem has **hundreds**), and can\'t sustain a stablecoin because there\'s not enough liquidity compared to \\"the top dogs\\". What are the chances these guys can make it?\\n\\nOr take this example from the sme white paper:\\n\\n> The main idea of Cellframe is multiple subchains, containing Plasma (any blockchain element) inside of syngeneic Cells (shards). \\n\\nDoes this sound like Polkadot\'s parachains (which xx Netowrk could adopt and use)? Does \\n\\nAnd from the [roadmap page](https://cellframe.net/roadmap/), here\'s what is *yet to be done*:\\n\\n- Release of mechanism for stakers to delegate keys to validators using Cellframe Dashboard (xx Chain has Simple Staking, adopted from the Polkadot ecosytem)\\n- EVM-compatible service (xx Chain could adopt it from Polkadot ecosystem)\\n- They\'re developing own format of interchangeable tokens (besed on the numbers, such as CF-20, it\'s similar to Ethereum\'s)\\n- Interoperability protocol, bridging with other blockchains (PolkadotSDK has several and more will be added faster than Cellframe can do it. xx Chain uses two token bridges (XRP and Ethereum))\\n\\n:::note\\n[They just got two-way bridging done](https://cellframe.net/blog/two-way-bridge-mode-dai-usdc-eth-bnb-available-for-withdrawal/), while wrapped XX coin is listing on DEXes (WXX(ERC20), WXX(BEP20)), so even with that they\'re still building out these relatively basic integrations while Substrate-based coins do this with relative ease. \\n\\nxx Network doesn\'t even focus on the coin itself and has most of what it needs (chain integrations-wise). Additionally, it costs relatively little to develop, test and maintain.\\n:::\\n\\nAs you can see the main [issue](https://cellframe.net/changelog/) I have with Cellframe is they are reinventing the wheel.\\n\\nExamples from two recent releases, 5.3-327 and 5.3-277:\\n\\n- Issue with serialization/deserialization of data in JSON-RPC\\n- Fork auto-resolution mechanism\\n- Functionality of the `tx_history-addr` command\\n\\nThis is what happens when you decide to build the wheel from scratch. Ongoing and yet-to-be discovered security and other problems. \\n\\nIf you\'re META or Ethereum, maybe you can pull it off. If you\'re not, well...\\n\\nInterestingly Cellframe runs a [VPN](https://kelvpn.com/), with the following pricing:\\n\\n![CELL VPN - KELVPN](/img/blog/2024-04-14-cell-vpn-pricing.png)\\n\\nThis reminds me of [Nym](/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork) and the risks I mentioned there (read it to get the idea, if you don\'t already have it)...\\n\\n> Although Cellframe and KelVPN are products from the same parent company, \u201cDemlabs,\u201d KelVPN is a separate project with a dedicated developer team. KelVPN is the first service built on Cellframe, which is a blockchain platform for different decentralized services. KelVPN is based on the Cellframe parachain and uses Cellframe SDK. \\n\\nFor a comparison, search this blog for \\"postage\\" or take a look at [this post](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#introduction): xx Network is a DAO and plans to provide paid mixnet servics in what I think is a much better way (no \\"parent company\\" and associated risks, crypto-only payments with XX coin obtained from a DEX or CEX).\\n\\nThe [FAQs](https://cellframe.net/faq/) gives the following examples of services that could run on Cellframe:\\n\\n- decentralized VPNs and CDNs\\n- messengers and social networks\\n- voting\\n\\nMessaging has worked on xx Network for years and is the focus of the network. Voting has also undergone a lot of research (see [Votexx](https://votexx.org/)) and implemented for [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/wave0-grant-recipients/votexx). \\n\\nIt appears some Cellframe services (or \\"ideas\\" of services) overlap with Nym\'s, others with other projects (e.g. StorJ for CNDs), and some with xx Network (except that xx Network has had them for a while and are xx Network\'s main focus).\\n\\nPQ-wise, Cellframe uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon. I haven\'t looked into these yet.\\n\\n### Opinion on CELL\\n\\nIt reminds me of Nym, but with some Ethereum features (basically nothing that one can\'t do on PolkadotSDK chains).\\n\\nWhile some use cases seem similar to xx Network\'s, they don\'t really have those apps because they\'ve been busy rebuilding the wheel. \\n\\n:::info\\nOne of the nice things about Cellframe is validators must be staked with 10,000 CELL. Currently that is over US$10,000.\\n\\nFor a comparison, today you can start validating on xx Network with $60. How is that even possible? \\n\\nWell, the xx Network community has its fair share of socialists who think everyone should be able to do what they want without anything at stake. That\'s easy to change and is [in the process of being changed as I write this](/blog/2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake), but it\'s crazy that this was made possible int the first place. \\n\\nI made a similar (positive) comment regarding Nym\'s approach to validation in the post about Nym.\\n:::\\n\\n## Quantum Resistant Ledger Markets (QRL)\\n\\nQRL has been around for a long time (longer than xx Network, six years vs three for xx Network), and has a decent following.\\n\\nQRL\'s mission is a PQ chain.\\n\\n> Provide enterprise grade security to the blockchain space with the future quantum threat in mind. \\n\\nThis is what they have at CMC:\\n\\n> The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is a \'fully quantum resistant blockchain network, using PQ-CRYPTO recommended/IETF standardized cryptography\'. The QRL utilizes a hash-based eXtended Merkle Tree Signature Scheme (XMSS) instead of ECDSA, which is reportedly vulnerable to quantum attacks and found in many other blockchain projects. \\n\\nWhat\'s that about ECDSA? Well, [NIST](https://fullcirclesecurity.org/2024/11/26/nist-announces-the-end-of-rsa-and-ecdsa/) announced its depreciation:\\n\\n> .. of RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA encryption algorithms by 2030, with a full disallowance by 2035.\\n\\nOMG, we\'re screwed!!!\\n\\nOr maybe not.\\n\\nHere\'s what [current draft](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf) of this deprecation plan says (as of 2024/12/14):\\n\\n![ECDSA depreciation schedule - draft](/img/blog/2024-04-14-ecdsa-depreciation-schedule-draft.png)\\n\\nUp to 11 years to go, and that\'s **if** you depend on ECDSA and must use it. xx Chain *does not have to* use ECDSA signatures.\\n\\n:::info\\nBitcoin uses [256-bit ECDSA](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm:\\n> For bitcoin these are Secp256k1 and SHA256(SHA256()) respectively. \\n:::\\n\\nThe [web site](https://www.theqrl.org/) says the their chain uses XMSS, a NIST-approved post-quantum secure digital signature scheme. \\n\\nSimilarly to Ozone Chain (below), they use lattice-key storage.\\n\\nQRL uses [RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX), a proof of work (PoW) algorithm based on random code execution. \\n\\nThey claim two audits, by red4sec and x41 D-sec, which is very nice but also expensive. As I recall xx Network had one audit, in 2021, for example.\\n\\nThey have post-quantum addresses developed in-house, which xx Network also has (Sleeve, mentioned further below in the xx Network section).\\n\\nIn terms of plans, here\'s what they have on their site on next generation of QRL:\\n\\n>  codenamed Zond, is introducing key features such as web3 compatibility and a proof-of-stake protocol with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract support. QRL Zond integrates post-quantum secure methods with Ethereum architecture, offering a secure platform for future applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).\\n\\nEVM support is nice and PolkadotSDK chains can also run EVM in addition to its own native ecosystem with hundreds of applications, but that is not the focus of xx Network (cMixx is).\\n\\n### Opinion on QRL\\n\\nWith its focus on chain and wallets, QRL is a \\"PQ-Litecoin\\", if you will. Monero is also a PoW chain, I don\'t see that QRL focuses on privacy, so I changed that to \\"PQ-Litecoin\\".\\n\\nHaving Sleeve-like wallet generator and two audits is very helpful for coin-based use cases.\\n\\nxx Network is a messaging forcused PQ project. Wallets (created with Sleeve) are PQ-secure and the chain itself is very likely going to become PQ-secure because Polkadot DAO is very well funded with a vibrant ecosystem (if you don\'t understand the value of PolkadotSDK to xx Chain, [see this post](/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem)).\\n\\nTo summarize: QRL has some advantages over xx Chain, but they may not be sustainable. On the other hand, it has no meaningful applications except the coin itself, while xx Network focuses on PQ-mixnet services.\\n\\n## Ozone Chain (OZO)\\n\\nFrom their CMC introduction:\\n\\n> Ozone chain uses quantum random numbers (QRN) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC)\\n> ... an architectural decision has been made to use PQC for inter-node communications, while being quantum-resistant at the same time.\\n\\n:::warning\\nEasily confusable with BOZO (also a coin)!\\n:::\\n\\nOzone\'s QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests. That\'s nice.\\n\\nOzone claims three PQ-related features:\\n\\n- QRNG - quantum process-based random number generator\\n- QKD - quantum key distribution\\n- PQC - post-quantum cryptography that uses lattice-based cryptography (whichis different from cMixx, for example). Resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers\\n\\nI\'m not sure how QKD works and why they need it. It\'s a [secret](https://ozonechain.io/validator-node/#a4):\\n\\n> 4. Setup quantum tunnels between your node and other nodes\\n> Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.\\n\\nWait, so is this a permissioned network as far as validation is concerned? Let\'s see (on the same page):\\n\\n> The new validator will be accepted by the network after a period of 6 hours mentioned by epochlength in the genesis file is passed and if it received the votes from a majority (above 50%) of existing validators within the 6 hours period. \\n\\nIt appears to be permissioned because you can\'t become a candidate without the developers\' help and once you do become a candidate, there\'s no market mechanism (such as NPoS on Substrate-based chains including xx Chain). NPoS isn\'t perfect, but this one is ... mysterious. You need to get permitted, and then lobby the existing validators to join in. That\'s strange, and maybe more \\"centralizing\\" than NPoS. \\n\\nAlso on the same page:\\n\\n> 9. Setup quantum tunnels between your node and the newly created nodes\\n> Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.\\n\\nIf Discord is down, you can\'t become a validator. \\n\\nAbout PQC in Ozone:\\n\\n> CRYSTALS-Kyber. CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) comprises two lattice-based cryptographic primitives: \\n> - Kyber, a CCA-secure KEM, and \\n> - Dilithium, a strongly EUF-CMA secure digital signature algorithm. \\n\\nThis isn\'t comparable to xx Chain (see other comments about PolkadotSDK-based chains), which don\'t claim PQC, and **users** of xx Network\'s cMixx mixnet aren\'t directly impacted by lack of chain-level PQC. \\n\\n:::note\\nIf xx Chain were to be compromised by a CRQC, it could indirectly compromise cMixx as well, but in obvious ways - such as large and/or sustained turnover in validators - which would likely also impact other Substrate-based chains unless the attacker focused solely on xx Chain. \\nI can\'t think of non-obvious ways that PQ-compromise of xx Chain would impact the security of cMixx. That doesn\'t mean there are none, of course.\\n:::\\n\\nOzone\'s QRNG sounds like snake oil to me. You can read about it [here](https://whitepaper.ozonechain.io/quantum-random-numbers). The reason I say that is the illustration implies custom hardware, so unless everyone has one, these random numbers may be emitted from a centralized source (\\"Ozone Foundation\\" or some 3rd party [beacon](https://random.colorado.edu/)?). If it\'s centralized, it\'s not good.\\n\\n:::info\\nPolkadotSDK-based chains can include Drand Bridge Pallet, a Drand-to-Substrate bridge.\\n\\nThere\'s also [dVRF](https://supra.com/vrf-product/), Supra\'s decentralized verifiable randomness service, which is mature and used in production by dozens of projects:\\n\\n> Supra dVRF solves on-chain randomness for Web3 at large, not just a few networks. We\u2019re already on 27 networks like Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.\\n\\nSupra\'s dVRF is available on Supra\'s L1, but as you can see from this quote above, other networks/chains use it in absence of a better native dVRF.\\n\\nIt doesn\'t appear that xx Chain needs a PQ VRF, as there are no applications (such as gambling or gaming) which require such randomness. When it becomes necessary xx Chain will likely use a PQ DVRF such as Drand Bridge Pallet (if it\'s PQ or after it becomes PQ).\\n:::\\n\\nOzone is EVM compatible and has half a dozen apps (DEX, memes, games) - all unrelated to what xx Network does.\\n\\nMy take: it\'s a PQ EVM platform on a small EVM-compatible chain. There are dozens of EVM-compatible chains that are larger and permissionless. \\n\\nOzone\'s transactions are currently around 4,000/day, while xx Chain has around 600 and many of them are nomination/validation-related, so it has to be said that xx Chain has very few transactions. Why is that? \\n\\nThe action on xx Network hapens on cMixx (mixnet), which is free to use and doesn\'t require any coins (XX or other). On the other hand, many of Ozone\'s transactions may be DEX and memecoin traffic. \\n\\nBlock times are 5 and 6 seconds, respectively, but in the case of xx Chain that\'s not realy pertinent to almost any relevant use case (as I\'ve mentioned, the action is happening on cMixx).\\n\\n### Opinion on QLR\\n\\nOzone\'s PQ-related features look nice, but it\'s a tiny platform where you may be PQ-ready, but can be excluded or banned at any time. The threat of that is probably higher than the threat of CRQC...\\n\\n## Comments on comments in the X thread\\n\\nShills of course flooded the thread with stupid comments, which I break down in two groups: on-topic (QANX, QuantumEVM) and off-topic (the rest, as of writing this post).\\n\\n### QAN blockchain platform (QANX)\\n\\nOne of the comments mentioned this coin.\\n\\nI won\'t waste time on it - [it\'s a company owned platform](https://learn.qanplatform.com/about-us/company) that has to turn a profit (got $15 million from VCs) or else.\\n\\n> 30+ team members spread across 10+ countries\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- PQ (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) - different from messaging focused PQ stack used by cMixx, but PolkadotSDK chains may end up with the same chain PQ algo down the road\\n- EVM and other VMs - same as PolkadotSDK-basaed chains\\n- Proof-of-Randomness (PoR) algorithm - see earlier comments on randomness\\n- 1600 TPS - less than xx Chain can do, but even with xxPostage xx Chain won\'t need many transactions\\n- Enterprise focus - okay... They run private chains for paying customers\\n\\n> Alpine Esports, a Group Renault brand, and inter alia in the Formula 1\xae Esports Series signed QANplatform as its Official Blockchain Partner.\\n\\nIt\'s a chain-focused token that won\'t make it without (eventually) government or EU handouts. You can see a hint of that here:\\n\\n> First EU country implemented QAN\u2019s quantum-resistant technology in March 2024. \\n\\nIf you have to burn your PQ budget with a EU startup, that\'s the place to go!\\n\\nIt doesn\'t seem their public network has launched (or they don\'t update their docs). According to [their roadmap](https://learn.qanplatform.com/about-us/roadmap) there\'s no public mainnet yet and they\'re still collecting validator applications (there\'s a Google Docs form on the same page).\\n\\nUsers interested in xx Network\'s use case (confidential messaging) won\'t use this one. But they may get some business from enterprise users running private PQ-based chains.\\n\\n:::info\\nI believe enterprises who want to pay can reach out to the xx Foundation for licensing and support. \\n\\nThe xx Network stack is possibly less expensive and very permissively licensed.\\n\\nAs far as chain features are concerned, [Supra](https://supra.com) (which I hold) will cush these guys.\\n:::\\n\\n### QuantumEVM\\n\\nThis is the same thing as QANON... sorry, QANX: Ethereum with PQ patches.\\n\\nxx Network isn\'t in PQ EVM or blockchain business, so there\'s noth much to compare, but aside from that, they don\'t have anything in place: it seems they\'re trying to ICO now, so they may be a year from a functioning decentralized mainnet, and even then they won\'t have anything similar to cMixx.\\n\\nI commented [here](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1868500204464546272).\\n\\n### Other coins in the X thread\\n\\nI saw a bunch of coins/chains mentioned in the thread. I checked five, and three of them were random shitposts pumping loser coins that have nothing in terms of PQ readiness.\\n\\nTwo I\'ve heard of, and was able to find something PQ-related:\\n\\n- Algorand (ALGO) - partially ready (uses FALCON), but VRF [is vulnerable](https://algorand.co/technology/post-quantum) and will have to be swapped out (same as PolkadotSDK-based chains). No sign of PQ in wallets (addresses), though.\\n- Hedera (HDR) - doesn\'t seem ready in any way. [This post](https://hedera.com/blog/post-quantum-crypto) explains that. No signs of any PQ features.\\n\\nAs you can see, they\'re very \\"L1-focused\\" (similar to the three coins higlighted by Altcoin Daily). Algorand\'s addresses and signatures may be in trouble and Hedera\'s probably, too.\\n\\nIn any case, they don\'t appear focused on PQ messaging, so who cares.\\n\\n## xx Network (XX)\\n\\nFirst, each stack of xx Network should be separately analyzed. I\'m not a cryptographer, \\n\\n### xx Chain (xx token)\\n\\nXX is the native token of xx chain. \\n\\nxx Chain is a Substrate- (or, PolkadotSDK-based) chain which is PQ-ready. Whazzit mean?\\n\\nIt means that once PolkadotSDK *is* PQ-ready, xx Chain will be updated to be ready as well.\\n\\nDoes that means all PolkadotSDK chains will be PQ-ready? Not really. \\n\\nxx Validators - and all who used [Sleeve](https://sleeve.xx.network/) have PQ-ready wallet addresses and PQ-ready wallet pass phrase. \\n\\n> Sleeve ... derives the quantum-secure wallet, which is not currently used, but will be necessary in the future in order to rollover existing non quantum secure wallets into quantum secure wallets.\\n\\nSleeve uses WOTS+ and has a defined path to upgrade the chain to support WOTS+ signatures in transactions and user accounts. From [the repo](https://github.com/xxfoundation/sleeve):\\n\\n>  uses a WOTS+ key as the underlying quantum secure key. After the WOTS+ key is generated, we save the quantum secure public key (PK). This public key will be used as the Wallet address when full quantum secure capabilities are implemented in the future.\\n\\nSooo.... xx Network is in a very good place. \\n\\nDo these other PQ coins have such wallets? As far as I can tell, QRL may have it. Those who don\'t won\'t become ready without migrating existing wallets.\\n\\nAny non-PQ ready chains **as well as** PQ-ready without PQ addresses will have to:\\n\\n- manually move all assets to a new quantum secure wallet (address)\\n- migrate blockchain signature system to WOTS+ (or similar)\\n\\nxx Chain wallets with Sleeve-generated wallets won\'t need to do any of this.\\n\\n### cMixx\\n\\nThe real PQ action - and why xx Network probably shouldn\'t be compared with those coins - is in cMixx. \\n\\ncMixx employs the following [cryptographic primitives](https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/design-specs/end_to_end):\\n\\n- XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.\\n- Blake2b: Length is 256 bits. Used as part of key generation, key expansion, identity generation, and identification codes. Used to combine Diffie\u2013Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.\\n- HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.\\n- Diffie\u2013Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.\\n- SIDH: Length of public key is 3024 bits. Quantum resistant component of key negotiation in theoriginal cMix. In **cMixx** (current implementation) SIDH was replaced by CSIDH.\\n\\n### xx Network development\\n\\nI don\'t speak for xx Network, but based on what\'s happening now and what I think will happen in the future:\\n\\n- xx Chain is PQ-ready and will adopt PQ enhancements from PolkadotSDK which will surely come about. Some enhancements (such as provable decentralized randomness) are already available, it\'s just that they\'re not necessary \\n- cMixx is the core service of xx Network and what sets it apart from these three coins. There are integrations for mixing wallet transactions (e.g. with Metamask), private and confidential ID lookups (Worldcoin) and Haven, a reference messaging platform. You can look at the current grants (on forum.xx.network) and see all of them are related to improving cMixx. One of \\n\\nI don\'t maintain this comparison, but see [here](https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html) how Haven (and cMixx in general) compares against other encrypted messengers.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Altcoin Daily post is meaningless. But obviously \\"it worked\\" because it made me spend time on writing this post.\\n\\nWhile all three coins (CELL, OZO, QRL) have PQ-ready chains, from what I can see not all have PQ addresses.\\n\\nSome have heavily centralized validation while others are backed by commercial entities (and therefore centralized). These factors present greater risks than CRQC.\\n\\nNone of them **focus** on messaging. Cellframe mentions it as a use case, but that\'s far from having anything usable and in production.\\n\\nxx Network\'s blockchain is already sufficiently PQ-resistant, and given Polkadot DAO\'s resources, will be ready before it becomes important. xx Network addresses generated with Sleeve are considered secure.\\n\\nxx Network\'s main service, cMixx, is also PQ-resistant. It\'s been in production for years (try [xx Network Haven here](https://haven.xx.network)), and has integrations unrelated to XX coin. In fact cMixx mixnet can be used for mixing wallet RPC calls of any coin (see Proxxy) and it can be done for free.\\n\\nEven when it comes to blockchain, xx Network has PQ and other features that rival those three projects: some xx Chain features are much better, and others can be added by integrating the currently unused components of PolkadotSDK. \\n\\nIn terms of PQ features of the chain itself, those chains may be ahead, but they are bogged down in re-developing the same chain features that have been developed elsewhere, with a fraction of Polkadot DAO\'s resources that xx Network can use for free (and that\'s not \\"porting\\" the way some of these coins do with Ethereum\'s features, but the relatively simpler \\"enabling\\").\\n\\nRegarding chain features, the three coins are ahead of other chains out there, but their problem can be summarized like so: aside from address readiness (which two seem to have), will other coins out there reach PQ before these coins reach their own escape velocity?\\n\\nxx Network shouldn\'t be directly compared with them, but I think it\'s better in both ways:\\n\\n- Chain-wise, some PQ features are less developed, some same or better (Sleeve). But xx Network\'s non-PQ features are way ahead due to the use of PolkadotSDK and these cost relatively little to develop and advance\\n- PQ services-wise, xx Network is focused on messaging and in that area ahead of all three. As for other services (unrelated to messaging mixnet), I think it\'s better to not focus on many - one use case is hard enough - so it doesn\'t bother me that cMixx can\'t do phone calls, or transfer files\\n\\n## Addendum\\n\\n- One of xx Network Sleeve\'s authors [comments on xx chain signatures](https://x.com/bernie_cardoso/status/1868543102342066227)"},{"id":"2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-10-xx-network-referendum-min-validator-stake-raise.md","title":"xx Network referendum (ID 27) on hiking the minimum validator stake","description":"What was voted on, why, and who was against","date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"},{"label":"economics","permalink":"/blog/tags/economics"}],"readingTime":2.195,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake","title":"xx Network referendum (ID 27) on hiking the minimum validator stake","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain","economics"],"description":"What was voted on, why, and who was against","keywords":["xx network","npos","validation","validator","stake","staking"],"image":"/img/blog/2024-12-10-xx-network-min-validator-stake-referendum.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Top PQ crypto coins for 2025 (according to Altcoin Daily)","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily"},"nextItem":{"title":"Good Samaritans of Supra Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/08/good-samaritans-of-supra-network"}},"content":"## Introduction \\n\\nRecently xx Network held its 28th democracy referendum (referendum ID 27) on the topic of hiking the minimum validator stake to 15,000 XX and subsequently as required (and depending on market conditions and the price of xx token).\\n\\nCurrently it is 1,000 XX which is just $60 - totally laughable!\\n\\n## How did we get here and why this hike was necessary\\n\\nOriginally the minimum validator stake was much higher (14,000 XX) and that was when the coin was several times more valuable. Now the minimum stake is 1/14 of the amount and 1/4 of the value, which means in fiat terms it\'s 1/64-th of what it was.\\n\\nAs usual, when it comes to bad decisions it\'s now unclear how \\"it was decided\\" to make the nonsense cut to 1,000 XX and who was/were the main supporter(s) of that when it was done.\\n\\nBut looking forward, it\'s easy to see that the current minimum validator stake doesn\'t make any sense. \\n\\n- It makes mockery out of NPOS. You can validate by staking $60\\n- It\'s bad for security of the network. You can stand up 200 validators by staking just $12,000\\n- It makes scamming easier for bad actors. You can stand up 30 validators with $1,800 and cycle through them and create new ones as you scam nominators on a different node every day\\n- It\'s a tiny fraction of minimum validator stake elsewhere\\n\\nUnbelievably, we still got a vote *against* the hike!\\n\\n## Who was against?\\n\\nJust `6ZFHpAxagxZV8E2GFyMEJoTgRvEsBgEh7vHMYSu6p7bLwufg`.\\n\\nYou can see [here](https://forum.xx.network/t/revised-increase-min-staking/7045/17) or on-chain: 114 in favor and 1 against.\\n\\nJust one voter was against this common-sense change and - surprise, surprise - it\'s a wallet associated with the pool trash:\\n\\n![Wallet that voted against xx Network referendum ID 27](/img/blog/2024-12-10-xx-network-min-validator-stake-referendum.png)\\n\\nTo the uninitiated, this validator (`MONEYTEAM 04`) nominated by the dissenting wallet belongs to a centralized farming pool `MONEYTEAM` which should be pushed out (and that\'s something I look forward to in 2025).\\n\\nThe wallet that voted against may very well be the sockpuppet operator behind this pool.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the current joke of the minimum stake has made the network more vulnerable to such abuse (centralized farming and weakned cMixx security).

(The network itself is promising.) \\n\\nAmong the problems, one of the small ones was that many \\"airdrop\\" users weren\'t able to \\"claim\\" their $SUPRA because they couldn\'t pay for the transaction fee required to do that.\\n\\nOf course, that\'s not really a problem: open a CEX account, buy $SUPRA and send it to your address. 15 minutes of easy labor.\\n\\nBut why work 15 minutes, solve your problem and put yourself in a position in which you can also help your fellow users (1), when you can beg for free in Supra Discord instead?\\n\\n(1) By this I mean residents of countries who cannot open accounts in currently available CEXes. None of the current tax haven CEXes accept US account holders, for example.\\n\\n## Good Samaritans\\n\\nFrom an economics perspective, there are several interesting things about this.\\n\\n### Discord admins\\n\\nDiscord channel admins allowed begging, which is commonly banned everywhere because it doesn\'t add any value. It is also counterproductive because it adds noise, and doesn\'t help the project (whereas sending uses to CEXes does).\\n\\n### Community members \\n\\nFirst, I was suprised that relatively few people in Discord complained, but I think I know why: nobody bothers to read anything but their own threads and the lax moderation makes that worse becuase there\'s simply too many stupid posts in the channel (#general on the Supra Discord). At the same time, many are mad about the problems in the claim process, so the administrators can\'t be as strict as they should be.\\n\\nSecond, some users, like [farmsenth.eth](https://x.com/icryptosystem/status/1862307333998596214) on X, offer to send 1 $SUPRA for \\"free\\" to anyone, to help them claim tokens. \\n\\nThe Supra guys reposted that, but I [commented about this on X](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1862378695790665822) saying it\'s a terrible idea that doesn\'t help Supra at all. Later I noticed a change - they started telling users to go to a CEX and buy $SUPRA - so looks like my feedback had some effect.\\n\\nI forgot to mention that feeding beggars just makes the problem worse because those who would reluctantly open a CEX account would decide to skip that and beg instead, seeing how it\'s allowed and works.\\n\\nThird, there were two groups of people who didn\'t feed the beggars (as much):\\n\\n- Zero-interest lenders: those who offered to lend 1 $SUPRA under the condition that the borrower pays back after they claim\\n- Predatory profiteers: those who offered to lend at a profit. I belong to this group.\\n\\n### Who\'s the bad guy here?\\n\\nPeople like **farmsenth.eth** are the worst, for reasons explained above and in the tweet. In this group, the Discord account **souravrockz** (maybe the same guy, I haven\'t looked) is particularly active, using free $SUPRAs as a marketing tool for gathering followers for his airdrop platform. If that\'s not definition of spamming, I don\'t know what is. But they let him anyway. **farmsenth.eth** does the same on X, buys followers while making CEX partners lose customers they probably justifiably expected to win when they invested in marketing and launch activities.\\n\\nThe lenders are not as bad, although they too do the same disservice to the network because they decrease liquidity by helping users stay \\"inactive\\" as far as CEXes are involved.\\n\\n:::note\\nNote that users who claim tokens without opening a CEX account **cannot actually do anything with them**. \\n\\nThere\'s no staking on Supra as of now and there are no DEXes for $SUPRA either, so there\'s no reason to help them - they **cannot possibly do anything with the coins if they do not create a CEX account**.\\n\\nThe only difference between helping them and not helping them is if you help them they won\'t need to **buy** few more $SUPRA - they can dump the tokens without any fiat investment in the process.\\n:::\\n\\nTypical example: buying 1,000 *and then immediately selling 790* $SUPRA leaves you with 210 $SUPRA that you can send to your wallet. Early on (within a week from the launch) that was less than a $2 in \\"additional investment\\". But the pikers were relentless. Why buy 210 when I can beg for 1?\\n\\n> How many supras in gas do I need to be able to claim bybit? It asks for a minimum purchase of 1000 supras. That is too much. Is there no way to get gas elsewhere?\\n> ~ beggar from Supra Discord\\n\\nProfiteers such as I are less bad than the lenders because by asking to be compensated we discourage begging (since not all beggars want to pay more back). \\n\\nI would prefer that beggars be banned or kicked so that there\'s no begging and everyone goes to CEX so that only a small minority (Americans and Europeans, mostly) asks for help. But begging is going on and the first two groups doing their thing, so I decided to participate using what I belive is the least bad approach.\\n\\nDid it work?\\n\\n- Yes, when no one from the other two groups (donors and lenders) happens to be online\\n- No, when someone from one or both groups offers to help out for free\\n\\n## Predatory lending?\\n\\nIs 500% interest per day predatory lending?\\n\\nNo, because it takes me minutes of work (copy, login, send, messaging) to do it and the \\"profit\\" was 8 $SUPRA (approximately 15 cents at the time) per customer.\\n\\nThat\'s not even US$ 9 per hour, so I worked for less than a minimum wage in the West while having capital at risk. Sorry, but I\'m not sorry!\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nAnother fun aspect of this has been profitability.\\n\\nI\'ve sent 2 $SUPRA to 4 people, each of whom agreed to pay me back 10 $SUPRA.\\n\\nOnly two paid back anything. From what I could tell, one was Chinese and one was American.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe user from China went above & beyond: he asked for 1 $SUPRA. I sent him 2 just to be sure he doesn\'t get stuck, and he sent me back 20 $SUPRA!\\n\\nMaybe he assumed the original 1-for-10 deal meant I expected 20 in exchange for 2 and he didn\'t want to make a big deal out of it. Real gentleman!\\n\\nI later sent him 9 $SUPRA to stick to the original deal (1 in exchange for 10).\\n:::\\n\\nThese two wallet owners weren\'t as nice. They agreed to receive 2 and pay back 10 (approximately $0.015 and $0.15, respectively, at the time) and failed to deliver:\\n\\n- [0x699c017fe9b7112a98e58d9896eee3c8fc57ca985f161527c1aeeb491c2093b7](https://suprascan.io/address/0x699c017fe9b7112a98e58d9896eee3c8fc57ca985f161527c1aeeb491c2093b7)\\n- [0xf1610d90bbc83b967a9b993f05de1e0eca61d2bf45003d840cd3cd0a896638e0](https://suprascan.io/address/0xf1610d90bbc83b967a9b993f05de1e0eca61d2bf45003d840cd3cd0a896638e0)\\n\\nThey didn\'t tell me why they didn\'t pay back, informed me why they couldn\'t, or told me about some delay or anything like that.\\n\\nFrom my side, I didn\'t ask them if they maybe \\"forgot\\" about the deal, but I\'ll gladly link their wallets here.\\n\\nAnother guy dropped out \\"in presales stage\\" - he wanted just 1 $SUPRA (not 2, which was stupid since the assumption was he\'d return both anyway), but didn\'t commit to returning any, so I disqualified him.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\n| Wallets | Amount Sent | Amount Repaid |\\n|------|-------------|---------------|\\n| 2 | 2 $SUPRA | 0 $SUPRA |\\n| 2 | 2 $SUPRA | 20 $SUPRA |\\n\\nThe spammers and lenders did another 20-30 transactions that I saw (and probably 10x more when I wasn\'t looking), so one of my conclusions is certainly that people who really needed help were few.\\n\\nThe rest were simply lazy or outright scammers. Some probably didn\'t even have any $SUPRA to claim - they just wanted to profit from begging.\\n\\nSince then $SUPRA went up a lot (it\'s $0.3 now), so I\'d probably ask 2 $SUPRA in return for 5 $SUPRA at current prices. I\'d ask for less, but given these levels of honesty it\'s hard to not lose money saving the world...\\n\\nI expect that aidrop spammer guy will soon stop giving free $SUPRA for nothing and - given these lending losses - I think the not-for-profit lenders will also go away.\\n\\nOnly profiteers will remain in the game.

Note that some are more advanced and NFT-focused, and there you can do a lot more.\\n\\n- NFTs come in \\"collections\\". A collection is identified by an ID, and has a bunch of properties\\n- Each NFT belongs to a collection. Example: collection ID 10 may have NFTs ID 1, 2, and 3\\n- NFTs can be minted, priced, transferred, bought, burned. Soul Bound NFTs are those that cannot be transferred once they\'re minted to a wallet\\n\\nOn xx Network, since there\'s no user-facing Web UI where you can see anything. There\'s a simple \\"NFT\\" page that\'s always empty and doesn\'t show any collections or holdings, which is confusing. You can own, but can\'t see if you own any collections or NFTs.\\n\\n![xx Chain - NFT page in xx Network Wallet](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-09-xx-network-wallet-nft-page.png)\\n\\nFor more on Polkadot SDK-based NFTs, see this page on the Polkadot Wiki: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nft-pallets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nft-pallets).\\n\\n## NFT operations\\n\\nThis is a partial list of NFT-related operations available on Polkadot (source: Polkadot NFT documentation).\\n\\n### Permissionless\\n\\nThese are not limited to the owner.\\n\\n- create: Create a new collection by placing a deposit\\n- mint: Mint a new item within a collection (when the minting is public)\\n- transfer: Send an item to a new owner\\n- set_price: Set the price for an item\\n- buy_item: Buy an item\\n- pay_tips: Pay tips, could be used for paying the creator royalties\\n- create_swap: Create an offer to swap an NFT for another NFT and optionally some fungibles\\n- cancel_swap: Cancel previously created swap offer\\n- claim_swap: Swap items in an atomic way\\n\\n### Permissioned \\n\\nThese are \\"admin\\" level actions for the issuer.\\n\\n- destroy: Destroy a collection.

That\'s collection ID 0, NFT ID 1 (`ntfs.mint`).\\n\\nHow I did that: go to Developer > Extinsics > Submission, pick `ntfs.mint(collection,item,mintTo,witnessData)` and for collection ID 0, mint 1 token to The-Dude (Reference: [extrinsic in block 15,955,159](https://wallet.xx.network/#/explorer/query/0x5ec8e84aef8c0fadb36869c900fba1da65934bcd497fd94b9fe77e5a05717c61))\\n\\n![xx Chain - mint NFT](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-03-mint.png)\\n\\nNow go to Developer > Chain state > Storage, `ntfs.collection` and check again.

That worked, but when I tried to transfer it to The-Dude, that wasn\'t possible (`nfts.transfer`). More on this later.\\n\\n![xx Chain - transfer NFT](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-02-transfer.png)\\n\\nIf the collection allows it, *item* properties can be changed later (`nfts.setMetadata`). This is for when we want to \\"customize\\" NFTs before making them available for sale or sending them to recepients. (Reference: [extrinsic](\\nhttps://wallet.xx.network/#/explorer/query/0x94bcd691323722d70c29b8e194beb60a719d98ced15fbd8899f07741e5043e2e))\\n\\n![xx Chain - set NFT item and collection properties](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-04-set-metadata.png)\\n\\nYou can also set a *custom* NFT item price to particular account. Earlier we set it to 1 XX, but you can override it like so.\\n\\n![xx Chain - set NFT item price](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-05-set-price.png)\\n\\n:::note\\n`Include option` is disabled, so no special price is set in the screenshot above.\\n\\nWe use that option again in the screenshot below.\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s an example of quantity discount - the first item is 1 XX (default price, also in the screenshot above), but item ID 2 from collection ID 0 is available at half the price (0.5 XX). \\n\\n![xx Chain - set NFT per-item and per-wallet discount](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-06-set-price-per-target-wallet.png)\\n\\nNotice this price is available only for The-Dude wallet (a \\"whitelisted\\" buyer, in the screenshot), because it\'s specifically called out in that extrinsic (`ntfs.setPrice`).\\n\\n### Recap\\n\\nSo far, this is what I got:\\n\\n- ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet creates a collection with the ID 0, up to 500 of them, priced at 1 XX\\n- ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet mints two NFTs (IDs 1 and 2):\\n  - ID 1 minted to The-Dude\\n  - ID 2 issued to himself\\n- ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet plays with settings, and makes just one big change - creates a year-end special for The-Dude: sets the price of NFT ID 2 to 0.5 XX \\n\\nWhat\'s minted to others gets \\"sent\\" to those wallets right away. \\n\\nWhen issuer only can mint, what\'s issued to self seemingly cannot be bought without the issuer\'s specific \\"offer\\" to a 3rd party wallet such as The-Dude. I haven\'t verified this, but it seems that\'s how it works.\\n\\n### Buy an NFT\\n\\nAnd the last screenshot shows how to buy that NFT ID 2 from the issuer who made it 50% cheaper than other items in the collection, so The-Dude buys it. (Reference: purchase [extrinsic](https://wallet.xx.network/#/explorer/query/0xb0cc3e57d89096aac2d5d899e284a1631cfe44916a13a4cda9e953e6b9b3bef4))\\n\\n![xx Chain - buy NFT](/img/blog/2024-12-07-xx-network-nft-07-buy-nft.png)\\n\\nI haven\'t tried using the API, but buying that NFT item for 0.5 XX would go similar to this:\\n\\n```python\\nsubstrate.compose_call( \'Nfts\', \'buy_item\', {\'bid_price\': 500000000, \'collection\': 0, \'item\': 2 })\\n```\\n\\nAfter purchase, this item ID 2 is in the possession of The-Dude aka six-ace:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> substrate.query( \'Nfts\', \'Item\', [0, 2])\\n<scale_info::575(value={\\n    \'owner\': \'6aCE19CakDJBp8wnVHB2HpHYfaeNiwx2RxQcsAcyWvPLVn5k\', \\n    \'approvals\': [], \\n    \'deposit\': {\\n        \'account\': \'6ZLGrh6Mu7uDioL7bAVS4kTsRSez7w1Lz18fiApUqRHNWnxd\', \\n        \'amount\': 1000000000}})>\\n```\\n\\nTo check the first NFT (ID 1) we\'d repeat the same call with `[0, 1]` to specify collection ID 0, item ID 1.\\n\\nUsing the same API, we can also look up prices like (Collection ID 0, Item ID 2 is 1 XX).\\n\\n:::note\\nNotice that this item is already in The-Dude\'s ownership, and that the price is 1 XX although The-Dude paid 0.5 XX for it.\\n\\nSince it was discounted just for The-Dude to 0.5 XX by the issuer *before* it was purchased, it appears *price paid* is not reflected in here. It\'s likely the initial price set on collection level, but make sure of it if you need to rely on that information.\\n:::\\n\\nThere are similar little details that should be checked further, such as the fact that the issuer may not be the only person who can mint NFTs in a collection (!), so make sure to read the docs before using these in production.\\n\\n## What can we do with NFTs?\\n\\nMany of the things everyone else does. \\n\\nSee that [post on token-gated access](/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network) for some ides as well as the PoC app and its source code.\\n\\nPersonally, now that I know this API works and how it compares to xx Chain assets, I think NFTs are even better for mebership- and subscription-like use cases than assets!\\n\\nThere\'s no need to buy NFTs \\"off the market\\" like assets, which is a major advantage. You can also set discounts, named buyers, and more. \\n\\nI\'m not interested in popular NFT use cases (memecoins, games and such), so the fact that the xx Network Wallet has nothing for that doesn\'t bother me at all. xx Network assets are much better in this regard - you can see which assets exists, and how holds how many - but doing anything with them is difficult and especially buying and selling.\\n\\nOther chains may have a more advanced NFT pallet, but I\'d say xx Chain doesn\'t even need those newer pallet. Other chains need apps that use NFTs, but xx Chain already has a good one - it\'s called Haven.\\n\\nWhile one may NFT-gate a Web site, you can\'t NFT-gate a Haven channel because the same channel (Space) can be accessed from any instance. But: we can [ask Haven users to sign their wallet address](/blog/2024/11/28/xx-validators-shall-we-play-a-game) using their wallet, and then easily check if the user owns an NFT (or some quantity of an xx Network asset).\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nxx Chain can do a lot more with NFTs than the spartan UI suggests - it\'s more than enough for some very interesting use cases.\\n\\nIt\'s shocking that no one has done anything with these so far, in over 1100 days since the chain launched.\\n\\nSome items for potential future work:\\n\\n- NFT-gated access: expand that PoC project with NFTs to have everything covered (XX coins, xx assets, and xx NFTs)\\n- Other: I have ideas for several interesting use cases where I\'d like to combine this with xx Network Haven communities.

As far as I can tell most Substrate-based chains do. \\n\\nI happen to care about xx Network and I don\'t think we should have _anyone_ control more nodes than the current cMixx round size (which is five).\\n\\nThere are variuos measures the xx Network Council has initiated to protect enhance decentralization, but as a demonstration of a working decentralized approach I\'m willing to spend some of my XX coins to make a point.\\n\\n### Did you know...\\n\\nThis is only loosely related, but: did you know that Polkadot has a community event called [\\"The Spammering\\"](https://polkadot.com/spammening) that is about to happen? \\n\\n> The Spammening, Polkadot\u2019s ultimate stress test! \\n> \\n> Polkadot is about to be put to the test as we push it to its limits in real-time. Get ready to witness the network\u2019s resilience and scalability under extreme load as we #RekTheMeter! \\n\\nThis game can be thought of as a watered-down version of xx Network spammering (and in the opposite direction).\\n\\n## The Mission in xx Network era 1107\\n\\nYour mission is to **[block an IPv4 address](#how-to-block-and-unblock-an-ip-address) of a cMix ID node (the cMix ID) during the game era** (\\"the era\\", which is 1107). \\n\\nThat IPv4 address will belong to a pool node identified by the cMix ID.\\n\\nThe cMix ID will be shared 3-4 hours before the era begins so that you have time to find and block the IP (which takes mere seconds - [see below](#how-to-block-and-unblock-an-ip-address)).\\n\\n:::note\\nIf less than six valid applications are accepted for era 1107, the game will continue in era 1108 for the remaining slots.\\n:::\\n\\n## Rewards\\n\\n### Rewards for participating validators\\n\\nYou will get **over 100% of your normal validator reward** if you successfully complete the mission. Those who partially (>50% failure rate) succeed will also get rewarded, but less.\\n\\nAssumption:\\n\\n- You make 40 XX in most recent era directly preceding the game era(s) (era 1106)\\n  - Assumption: node earnings 182 XX x 22% (maximum validator commission acceptable for this game)\\n\\nExamples of earnings for two outcomes with rewards:\\n\\n- Validator successfully fails **100% of cMixx rounds with the target** during the game\\n  - Due to these failures you make 30 XX in the era (lose 10 XX, (40 - 30)).

Applications for era 1108 will be possible as soon as era 1107 begins because by then we\'ll know how many unused slots we have for era 1108.\\n\\nYour earnings in era 1106 will be used in era 1108 reward formulas because the same validators may participate in both era 1107 and 1108.\\n:::\\n\\nIf five or more validators hit 100% failure rate with the target(s), I may give additional rewards to those five validators. I may also lower the criteria for above rewards if the target makes frequent changes to the IP address that make achieving these objectives hard.\\n\\nPlease check [the rules and qualifying criteria](#rules-and-crieteria-for-participating-validators).\\n\\n### Rewards for Space chat participants (non-validators welcome!)\\n\\nContributing and silent observers are welcome to join the Space.

I could use multi-sig and a trusted co-signer to get minimum deposits for no-show participants, but this is easier.\\n\\n### Rules and crieteria for participating validators\\n\\nI have to share wallet addresses because everyone must be able to verify that all applicants are qualified. That\'s why I cannot accept applications via DM.\\n\\n- First 10 **qualified** participants who apply will be accepted\\n  - If you see more than 10 submissions maybe it\'s not too late to apply - you may want to check those wallet addresses to see if the applicants qualify. If they obviously don\'t, submit your\\n  - As I check each application, I will comment and approve or reject until 10 have been approved or the era begins (whichever comes sooner)\\n- Objections regarding qualifications can be shared in the Space\\n- You may DM me with private questions\\n- No applicants details from DM will be shared or retained by me (whether or not you\'re accepted)\\n  - Note the xx Haven Space is public, so if you join the Space others will be able to see your Haven ID\\n    - You may join the Haven Space using a disposable Haven ID, submit your application, then leave the Space and optionally rejoin with a different Haven ID to monitor updates. \\n\\n:::warning\\nApproved no-show participants may have their wallet addresses posted on my blog.\\n\\nThis is the main reason why I ask for signed wallet information prior to the game.\\n\\nPlease do not apply if you do not intend to participate.\\n:::\\n\\n#### Criteria for validators\\n\\nThe first 10 people who post their **signed** wallet addresses and meet the following criteria:\\n\\n- Active validator in the era directly preceding \\"the era\\" (of the game)\\n- 22% or lower commission the era prior to, and during, the game\\n- At least 15K XX validator stake on the node in the game era (if you don\'t have now, you can bond before the era and unbond later)\\n- Not a pool wallet. Wallets from pool nodes or obvious node farmers with 5 or more nodes will not be accepted\\n- No nodes with recent history of > 25% commission as per xx Network Wallet (validator commission chart in the official wallet - see this [example](https://wallet.xx.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.xx.network#/staking/query/6VPoNGcw4QnU6oCGbT4Fqe6PwGRu6JVTXSWQ6dmj5SpPx77Q) of a qualified node in terms of validator\'s commission history)\\n\\nNote that some delays may happen in posting how many people have qualified.\\n\\nExpected Haven message format for validator submission:\\n\\n```raw\\nVALIDATOR\\nAddress: <address>\\nSignature: <walletSignature>\\n```\\n\\nSee [technical tips](#technical-tips) on how to do this.\\n\\n:::note\\nValidators don\'t need to make a separate submission for chat rewards - if you participate and win, I\'ll use your validator node wallet to pay out.\\n\\nBut if you submit your validator application using one Haven ID and then rejoin for chat using another, please submit a chat address signature as well (if you want to qualify for the chat reward).\\n:::\\n\\n### Rules for non-validating chat participants\\n\\nSoft requirement: sign a XX wallet using the same wallet address.\\n\\n- Those without a signed wallet may be blocked at my discretion\\n- Those without a signed wallet won\'t qualify for chat rewards (because I wouldn\'t be able to pay them)\\n\\nExpected Haven message format for validator submission:\\n\\n```raw\\nCHAT\\nAddress: <address>\\nSignature: <walletSignature>\\n```\\n\\nSee [technical tips](#technical-tips) on how to do this.\\n\\n## Payouts\\n\\nThe payout will happen within three eras after the game era. Why so long? \\n\\nBecause I need to check thousands of rounds of the target node and make sure that participating validators have not participated in any of the successful ones. That will take time.\\n\\nI plan to write a script that checks all rounds or (worst case) manually check a sufficiently big ample of the target\'s **successful** rounds and verify that each participant\'s node has failed more than 50% or all 100% of them in during the era.\\n\\nChat rewards will be dispensed promptly.\\n\\n## Technical tips\\n\\n### How to find IP address for the validator? \\n\\nSearch the cMixx log for cMix ID `0wjnYzegPz42ZZVc_dpB0RMRfddbEbdy_AkmsBbyrdMC` or its substring:\\n\\n```sh\\ncat /opt/xxnetwork/log/cmix.log | grep \\"Disconnected from 0wjnYzegPz42ZZVc\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf you can\'t find it, ask for help in the Space.\\n\\n### How to block and unblock an IP address?\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw deny from <ip address>\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nUse `sudo ufw status numbered` before and after you add the rule, and note the new rule number. \\n\\nYou can delete this new rule later with `sudo ufw delete NUMBER` where `NUMBER` is the new rule(s) you added.\\n\\nFor more tips see the official examples at [ubuntu.com](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW).\\n:::\\n\\n### How to sign your wallet address?\\n\\nLook at the screenshot or see [this](/docs/haven-user-guide/identity_external#prove-ownership-of-xx-network-cmixx-identity-using-xx-network-wallet) example. \\n\\n![Sign your wallet](/img/blog/2024-11-28-sign-wallet.png)\\n\\n- Validators: sign your node\'s validator\'s (not controller\'s) wallet address. From that I can see your cMixx ID for the game era, and check if meet the qualifying criteria. Validators are automatically qualified for chat rewards\\n- Non-validating chat participants: sign any wallet address (to which you hope to receive chat reward) using the same wallet\\n\\nBased on the output in the screenshot above, the validator would paste this into the Haven Space:\\n\\n```raw\\nVALIDATOR\\nAddress: 6aCE19CakDJBp8wnVHB2HpHYfaeNiwx2RxQcsAcyWvPLVn5k\\nSignature: 0x9071685d1321e337a7e5b6bcecba433dc75ed18e5ac6e867fccb18ad2c1c31427757d241d021b6b8bcb5450472d65abb0ab5a261c4cfcd013ef089bd791a588a\\n```\\n\\nChat participants would just replace `VALIDATOR` with `CHAT` - the rest would be the same.\\n\\n### What happens to my validator if I participate?\\n\\nRounds in which the blocked IP participates would fail due to pre-comp timeout. Other rounds will work fine. \\n\\nIf your node was to fail 20% of the rounds, you\'d make close to 20% less, i.e. your validator earnings would drop by almost 20% of your commission (assuming your commission is 22% that would be 22% - (20% x 22%) or a drop of less than 5 XX).\\n\\nYour nominators will be similarly impacted, but they\'ll be fully compensated as I\'ve explained above.\\n\\n:::note\\nIf you have additional technical questions, ask them [in the Space](http://haven.xx.network/join?0Name=ArmchairAncapChat&1Description=Try+xx+Network+Haven+and+reach+out+to+ArmchairAncap&2Level=Public&3Created=1732692927922678886&e=TQgPEWN079KR%2B1JMiZjPzLDH%2Bm0uCYGsnSMNx56Jyu0%3D&k=l4n1Ii%2F5NVOSJ7Qi4g5cODJGSmFBvT1o21XCvPytXh8%3D&l=368&m=0&p=1&s=98wvn1rhsyAPuhe1j7w%2Fx9nw0qqsjRL1JcK3tzY9Gz0%3D&v=1) (do not use DMs for public questions) and I\'ll add them to this page.\\n:::\\n\\n## Questions and answers about the game\\n\\n### What happens if the target changes their IP address?\\n\\nThere are several potential targets, so they\'re unlikely to watch our Space and change IP address before or during our little game. If they do, though, let\'s consider some scenarios:\\n\\n- the target changes their IP address *before* beginning of the era: nothing changes for us. You may want to delete the outdated firewall rule and create a new one, and still earn partial rewards even if you do that hours into the game era - you just need to fail more than 50% of common rounds shared with the target\\n- the target changes their IP address *after* beginning of the game era: my reward criteria will likely be loosened, but you can still modify your firewall rules to make more\\n  - if they change the node IP eight hours into an era and you update your rule 10 hours into an era, you can still meet the objective for more than 50% of the rounds and get the second tier reward\\n  - if they change several times during the game era (which I can check in my own logs), rewards will be prorated for the longest stretch (e.g. 6 hours) between two changes will be considered. In that case your node would make normal earnings for 24-6 hours (as blocking would fail), and I\'d pay out a quarter (6/24 hours) of rewards. For six hours of successful blocking on a node that made 50 XX in that era, I\'d reward you 50 x (1/4) x 100% (12.5 XX) if all of your rounds shared with the target during those six hours failed\\n\\nIn any case, you and your nominators won\'t make *less* in the era unless you act completely incompetently and mess up your node.\\n\\n### How can I time the firewall rule to begin or end just before or after the era?\\n\\nUse the `sleep` command or use OS scheduler. For example, you can login as `root` (or a passwordless sudoer) and run the rule delete command after the sleep command.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw deny ...        # enable blocking \\nsudo ufw list numbered   # note the rule number\\nsu - root                # passwordless suders don\'t need this\\nsleep 87000 && ufw delete ... # remove the rule (by the number)\\n```\\n\\nOr simply just login tomorrow and remove the rule any time in the next era.\\n\\n### How does the nominator compensation work?\\n\\nIn the era before the game, your node earns 190 XX. In the era, if you do well your node will earn less, let\'s say 160 XX.\\n\\nI will compensate your nominators for that difference (which would be (190 x 22%) - (160 x 22%)).\\n\\nI will check every winner\'s nominators in the game era and send each nominator their ideal share of the loss. For example: if a nominator has 30% of all nominations, they\'ll get 30% of 6.6 XX (total drop of nominators\' earnings after validator\'s commission is deducted).\\n\\n### What is the expected outcome\\n\\nIt is to estimate the effect (reward reduction for bad actors and their nominators) and costs (drop in rewards for the rest of us) of a community action like this. It\'s a special take on Polkadot\'s spammering, so to speak.\\n\\nIdeally I\'d like the community to be able to hurt pools in a cost-effective fashion.\\n\\nAlternatively, the network can use formal measures by the Council or democracy vote, but voluntary community action is vastly superior to that approach.\\n\\n:::note\\nIdeally, it would be organized by the community and I wouldn\'t have to spend my time and tokens doing all this on my own, but it is what it is.\\n:::\\n\\n### Is denying IPv4 access the best way\\n\\nIt\'s not, but it\'s easiest. \\n\\nParticipants are free to use any way they want to fail rounds with the target.\\n\\n## Sample game workflow for validators\\n\\n[Sign your validator wallet address](https://wallet.xx.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.xx.network#/signing) using the same address [as explained above](#how-to-sign-your-wallet-address).\\n\\nPaste the address and signature into the Haven Space:\\n\\n```raw\\nVALIDATOR\\nAddress: <yourValidatorWalletAddress>\\nSignature: <generatedSignature>\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nHaven v0.3.22 has a paste bug. Use CTRL+P or similar if pasting with the mouse does not work.\\n:::\\n\\n\\nI\'ll review and - at least two hours before start of the era - publish up to 10 accepted participants\' addresses and name the target (example: cMix ID `0wjnYzegPz42ZZVc_dpB0RMRfddbEbdy_AkmsBbyrdMC`).\\n\\nFind the IP address: \\n\\n```sh\\ncat /opt/xxnetwork/log/cmix.log | grep \\"Disconnected from 0wjnYzegPz42ZZVc\\"\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s say this shows you the IP address is 1.2.3.4. \\n\\nShortly **before** the era begins, block the IP and note the UFW rule number:\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw deny from 1.2.3.4\\nsudo sudo ufw list numbered\\n```\\n\\n:::warning\\nDo not paste the example IP address (1.2.3.4). Use the correct target\'s IP address. You may create multiple rules if you wish.\\n\\nThen record the new rule numbers - you\'ll need them to remove them later.\\n:::\\n\\n**After** the era begins, use the xx Network Dashboard to confirm rounds are falling.\\n\\nYou may login or recheck the dashboard during the era to confirm the target is still using the same IP. If not, remove the existing UFW rule and update it to continue blocking.\\n\\nYou can do this to remove the rule in little over 24 hours.\\n\\n```sh\\nsu - root\\nsleep 87000 && ufw delete <ruleNumber>\\n```\\n\\nDo not log out. If that is not secure, then use `screen` to issue the command and detach, or create a one-time cronjob.\\n\\n:::tip\\n87,000 seconds is 1 day and 10 minutes.\\n\\nUse multiple delete commands to delete multiple rules.\\n\\nFor multiple rules, delete them in descending order. If you added rules 4, 5 and 6, first delete 6, then 5, then 4. Otherwise delete rule 4 three times.\\n:::\\n\\nOr you can login in the next era and remove the rule(s) with `sudo ufw delete <ruleNumber>`. \\n\\nLogin after the era to confirm the node is no longer blocked in `ufw`.

(Ironically, this won\'t be published *soon* as I\'m still waiting for Github to tell me what I did to have my account suspended - but more on that once I find out!)\\n\\nClaim: very few xx Network community members realize or highlight opportunities related to the fact that xx Network uses a Substrate-based chain. \\n\\nAccording to [this](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot) article, there\'s over 300 projects in the Polkadot SDK-based ecosystem.\\n\\n## What matters and what doesn\'t\\n\\nDr. Chaum and the Team behind xx Network are well aware of the benefits of having a Substrate-based chain, but years after the launch 90% of community members are still mesmerized and distracted by the peripheral stuff. \\n\\nWhat\'s periferal stuff?\\n\\nIt\'s both old and new things - the BIS/CBDC trials, the Charles Hutchison-Trump administration thing, digital voting in government-organized elections...\\n\\n## Why care about the Polkadot ecosystem?\\n\\nThe Team of course knows the value of Polkadot ecosystem which is why they picked a Substrate-based chain. \\n\\nBut if one looks at what most people in the community are paying attention to, most don\'t appear to see it. They\'re blinded by the seeming ease of scoring bigly, or simply too lazy to learn about the less obvious opportunities, and so they tirelessly look in the wrong places.\\n\\nSuch as? Various quantum computing news, the Charles/Trump thing, rumored crypto payments on X, etc. \\n\\n:::note\\nThe obsession about quantum computing news is very strange to me.\\n\\nOn the one hand, that\'s one of two main things in cMixx (the other is that it\'s a mixnet). The threat is real, it is now (\\"Harvest now, decrypt later\\"). But it\'s one thing to mention it, and another to obsess about quantum computing-related news and ignore almost everything else. \\n\\nOr worse, to think that some government will use cMixx because it uses PQC. This week I skimmed through some EU-originated PQC work and they\'re happily researching their own and plan to get it done in the late 20s. Why would they use cMixx when it could make them redundant? It\'s no different in any other country or union.\\n:::\\n\\nIt is true that Dr. Chaum himself has participated in BIS/CBDC-related research and evaluations, but that\'s because he should. I wouldn\'t expect, or want him to build embedded wallets. He is focused on the tech behind cMixx and the best evagelist and promoter we have.\\n\\nBut the opportunities that Polkadot SDK offers to xx Network are many and significant.\\n\\n- **approachable**: they\'re suitable for community and developer engagement. You and that dApp developer you know don\'t need a PhD in cryptography or deep understanding of the workings of central banks in order to use cMixx and xx Chain to create useful and practical solutions today\\n- **immediate**: some of my ideas for dDpps require mere days to develop and launch. I know because I\'ve done some simple ones myself. They don\'t take quarters to discuss and years to develop, trial and put in production. You don\'t need to look for \\"investors\\" to fund their development. Imagine & implement!\\n- **low-cost**: in some cases, 7 engineer days to users and maybe even revenue\\n- **permissionless**: these opportunities are real and don\'t depend on anyone reaching out to Elon or some political figure doing us a favor (or even realizing that it\'d be us doing them a favor)\\n\\nI could go on, but hodlers are doing themselves disservice looking for opportunities in the wrong places.\\n\\nHow hard is it to realize that fiat currencies aren\'t meant to be transparent, decentralized or private? It seems very. It won\'t happen. \\n\\nYes, cMixx *should* be trialed with the BIS and central banks. Why?\\n\\n- to show that it won\'t happen despite the tech being there. In other words, to expose central banks and governments so that everyone can see that it\'s not about technical challenges, \\"the tech not being there\\" or whatever other excuse they come up with\\n- to scientifically and practically prove that xx Network can do this for private/permissionless use cases\\n\\nI\'m convinced 95% of people in the xx Network community don\'t realize or disagree with the above two points. But these are the key points when it comes to choosing where to engage and contribute (especially since most of us neither connected nor *qualified* to contribute - and no, asking \\"wen\\" doesn\'t count).\\n\\nIf anything, post-quantum mixnets **may be** implemented by central banks and governments, but in order *to hide* their own inner workings from taxpayers and public debt investors. \\n\\nIn other words, they may implement them to hide and obfuscate transactions between central banks or between central banks and private banks with whom they do business. It won\'t be on xx Network or any other public mixnet or chain. Got it?\\n\\n## What opportunities are there?\\n\\nI hope I shouldn\'t need to explain, but given the visual impairedness of many in the community, I\'ll mention several examples:\\n\\n- My recent posts on dApps and Hacktoberfest 2024 wins give some concrete examples\\n- Other opportunities (high-level only, as I may try to realize some of them):\\n  - Most Substrate-based (aka Polkadot SDK-based) wallets can access xx Chain \\n  - All xx Chain addressses are valid on *almost every* Substrate-based chain\\n  - Almost all Polkadot-related projects could use xx Chain and make use of cMixx (xx Network mixnet service)\\n\\nI\'ll explore each of these claims, but feel free to skim through them if you understood what I meant to say.\\n\\n### xx coin in Substrate walelts\\n\\nIf one has \\"a\\" Substrate based wallet, they can likely use it to hold xx coin. \\n\\nNot a big deal, there are many wallets that work with multiple chains, right? \\n\\nYes, but you have to pick a wallet that supports two or more coins that you have which in many cases means some L2 and therefore L1 - often Ethereum, which has been stagnant. Sometimes, if you use two L2s, you may need *two* Ethereum wallets. Or maybe three if you also use another chain. Oops!\\n\\n:::note\\nIn the interest of disclosure: I am not a fan of Ethereum *and* Bitcoin and I belive they\'re outdated. \\nBecause of that, two months ago I put a small amount of fiat into some other, newer L1 networks and they\'ve done very well (relative to both ETH and BTC). \\n\\nAlso importantly, I do think coins and L1/L2\'s are fungible in the mid- to long-term, so what\'s modern and superior today may not be five years down the road. It depends on the innovation, development, etc.\\n\\nAnd finally, much of my crypto is in XX token and do not encourage anyone to buy any crypto token. \\n\\nAll this is just FYI to may clear I\'m not pumping any coin or network here.\\n:::\\n\\nFor bitcoiners, it\'s even worse because there\'s barely anything going on there in terms of useful decentralized applications. Anyone who uses crypto (rather than keep their BTC parked and watch the number go up and down) needs wallet one for Bitcoin and several for other useful apps (other L1/L2 chains).\\n\\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, there are *many* good L1 *and* L2 chains and apps. You usually need just one wallet to access all your tokens and NFTs. You may not be able to *use an app* from the wallet if the wallet doesn\'t offer integration with the app, but you\'ll see your coin in almost any wallet for Substrate-bsed chains.\\n\\nThat makes it easy to own XX token and enables cross-polination across Substrate-based networks.\\n\\n### Universal Polkadot addresses\\n\\nThat first statement about xx Chain adddresses being the same across all Substrate chains isn\'t entirely correct as stated above - that was purposedly simplified. \\n\\nWhat\'s valid across most Substrate chains is your regular wallet pass phrase and private key(s). SS58 addresses are different for every chain, but can be derived from the same pass phrase or private key(s).\\n\\nWhy should we care? Because you can have a Substrate wallet that uses a *single* pass phrase for (probably) *any dApp* in the Polkadot ecosystem. \\n\\nConsider this simple pitch from [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/):\\n\\n> Manage multiple seed phrases with only one master password. SubWallet supports 150+ networks, 450+ tokens, and 80+ dApps.\\n\\nAn xx Network address looks differently from its Polkadot \\"representation\\", but these are - and must be, to prevent confusion and loss - because these are different SS58 networks. That is amazing.\\n\\n### xx chain can integrate with many Polkadot projects\\n\\nBecause of the two earlier points, Substrate L1 and L2 chains and apps can be easily interconnected. \\n\\nWhat if I use Kusama and need to pay for cMixx \\"postage\\" (i.e. \\"premium\\" service tier, [once xxPostage becomes available](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage))? \\n\\nI\'ll need only one wallet, just one pass phrase, KSM (tokens) and the ability to buy and sell XX tokens on a DEX to pay for \\"postage\\" on xx Network. cMixx postage hasn\'t been implemented yet, but the only thing that\'s missing is the ability to buy/sell XX coin with KSM which is technically possible today (e.g. see [Hydration](https://hydration.net/)) and only a matter of making a small-to-moderate implementation effort.\\n\\nWhat if I use XX token and want to use for some non-zero cost service on one of the many Substrate-based chains? \\n\\nThe same thing - one wallet, one pass phrase, and the ability to buy/sell other Substrate tokens - directly or indirectly (e.g. sell XX token to buy DOT or KSM, then sell DOT or KSM to buy the Substrate L1 token you need). \\n\\nUntil direct or indirect on-Substrate-chain DEXes that support XX token become available, one can still do this by using a DEX outside of the Substrate chain ecosystem, but for that we need a wallet that supports said DEX. At this time the easiest way to buy/sell in either direction would be to use a DEX and Ethereum-based wrapped XX coin. That\'s not perfectly convenient, but at least it doesn\'t require much overhead - it takes minutes at most. \\n\\nFor free services on Substrate-based entworks (where there\'s no need for buying and selling) - you can access them as soon as they\'re implemented. For example, the [token- and asset-gated acces](/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access) demo app only requires ocassional, potentially one-time transfer or transaction and you\'re good to go for months if not years. Some don\'t require any, for example in the case a site lets you access it with *any* Substrate-based token, as long as the USD equivalent of your balance is more than 10 dollars.\\n\\n## Past and present examples and opportunities\\n\\nIn addition to the dApps I wrote about recently, I want to highlight one opportunity which I thought was real, and that was to evangelize and popularize the integration with Crust Network, a Substate-based network storage project.\\n\\nxx Network added a Curst Network files app to the official xx Network wallet, but most people didn\'t pay attention or didn\'t want to think about it, so the feature wasn\'t maintained or improved and now it doesn\'t work (it appears Crust Network no longer maintains that pallet/API).\\n\\nCrust Network isn\'t equally private and post-quantum resistant, but it\'s convenient and not less private that 99% of other chat apps let you upload \\"attachments\\" or inline images.\\n\\nWhat if the idea didn\'t make any sense? Was it practical and usable at all? I\'ve no doubt it was. \\n\\n- Text - and Crust Network download links - go to cMixx\\n- Blobs (memes, audio clips, etc) go to Crust Network storage nodes and can be downloaded or shown inline in cMixx chat app\\n\\nYou lose some privacy for such binary data, but that\'s a low-cost tradeoff. In return we could have had \\"unlimited\\" size attachments in cMixx chat apps for 2 years now. But no one showed much interest and we still don\'t have that feature in Haven today.\\n\\nWhile Crust Network is now out of the focus due to low interest, similar opportunities abound so I know what I\'ll do - I\'ll be looking at other opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem because they\'re approachable, immediate, low-cost and permissionless.\\n\\n[Proxxy](https://learn.xx.network/dapps/proxxy) is another low-hanging fruit. As a reminder, it proxies chain RPC calls through cMixx, which means once *a* Substrate-based chain becomes supported by Proxxy, many Substrate chains could be supported within days. xx Network\'s cMixx mixnet is free to use and there\'s 300 projects that could add this \\"enhanced privacy\\" feature easily. And maybe just four-five wallets would have to be enabled to add this feature to hundreds of Polkadot SDK-based projects, to put it another way and tie with those earlire points mentioned above.\\n\\nProxxy originally focused on Ethereum wallets and just like with Crust Network integration, the community thought it\'s better to focus on those \\"high-profile\\" use cases I find unlikely to happen. I think Proxy should focus on Substrate-based chains instead.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nMany dApps from the Polkadot ecosystem could be used directly from xx Chain wallet and many Substrate chains could have a privacy setting that flips their wallet RPC transactions to use cMixx even if they don\'t pay for it with xx coin. That works today.\\n\\nThe lack of a mobile Haven client - once XX Messenger was discontinued  - has been hindering such dApps and integrations, but thanks to one of the winners of Hacktoberfest 2024 now we have a responsive Haven application that works from Android clients. It doesn\'t work *great* (it\'s not power-efficient on mobile - those improvements need to be added), but it works. If your mobile device connects to cMixx periodically - for example to download notifications or batch-upload data - there\'s no problem to do that on Android today.\\n\\nIf we look in the right places, and those places are *not* in central banks or governments, opportunities are plenty. Take a look at [this State of Polkadot](https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q3-2024) report to understand this better.\\n\\nI look forward to seeing - and maybe even creating some related PoCs - some cool Polkadot ecosystem integrations happen in 2025."},{"id":"2024/11/11/xx-chain-block-dumper","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-chain-block-dumper","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-11-xx-chain-block-dumper.md","title":"Dump xx Chain block contents with xxblockdumper","description":"Dump xx chain block contents to JSON","date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"}],"readingTime":3.79,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/11/11/xx-chain-block-dumper","title":"Dump xx Chain block contents with xxblockdumper","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain"],"description":"Dump xx chain block contents to JSON","keywords":["xx network","chain","scalecodec","xx chain","explorer","scan","events"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Network and Polkadot ecosystem","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why dApps for xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps"}},"content":"- [xxblockdumper](#xxblockdumper)\\n- [Using with xx chain](#using-with-xx-chain)\\n- [What does this all mean](#what-does-this-all-mean)\\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\\n\\n## xxblockdumper \\n\\n[xxblockdumper](https://git.xx.network/carback1/xxblockdumper) is another nice utility from Rick.\\n\\nIt aims to provide the following features to xx chain users (from current repo description):\\n\\n- Fetch complete block data from any Substrate-based chain\\n- Retrieve state data and extrinsics\\n- Export data to JSON format\\n- Support for latest or specific block numbers\\n- Configurable node endpoint\\n- Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff\\n\\n## Using with xx chain\\n\\nDownload, install, use. \\n\\nThree comments regarding today\'s `main` tree:\\n- Currently `click.echo(f\\"Debug - Block structure: {json.dumps(block, indent=2)}\\", err=True)` causes SCALE codec malfunction, so I mark it out before installing (this will probably get fixed soon)\\n- I\'ve updated some packages before installing, including Python Substrate Interface and SCALE codec, but this will probably be updated in `main` soon\\n- `-n ${BLOCKNUMBER}` is optional and `None` means `CURRENT`\\n- You may see this error as well\\n\\n```sh\\n$ blockdumper -n ws://192.168.1.3:63007\\n\\nConnecting to node: ws://192.168.1.3:63007\\nFetching data for latest\\nBlock hash: 0x610dfaf8cfae9c0cc7478183e490cf38f56c497f48b9dd744b5fec9f20777bde\\nError fetching state data: {\'code\': -32702, \'message\': \'Response is too big\', \'data\': \'Exceeded max limit of 1048576\'}\\n```\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nChange your xx chain configuration to allow large responses and restart chain service.

Nodes discard state fairly quickly depending on settings (minutes or hours).\\n\\nFor example, my dump file above contained many entries like these:\\n\\n```raw\\n\\"Error fetching storage: \\n{\\n    \'code\': -32000, \\n    \'message\': \'Client error: UnknownBlock: State already discarded for 0x463b0a5145b3a2b5b8d10e5572122a554f0eb9772712a787b4a6ffd2edc1f2a0\'\\n}\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn order for xxblockdumper to work you need an archive node. \\n\\nAlternatively, if you look for current or very recent blocks and have a fast system, but state pruning timeout is 256 blocks, so for 1 hour you\'d need (60s/6bps)x60 min= 600 at least.\\n\\n```raw\\n./xxnetwork-chain -h | grep pruning\\n      --state-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>\\n          Specify the state pruning mode [default: 256]\\n      --blocks-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>\\n          Specify the blocks pruning mode [default: archive-canonical]\\n```\\n\\n`--blocks-pruning archive` is what will always work, but xx chain node will need hundreds of GBs, possibly on flash media.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nxxblockdumper provides convenience to Python users who want to work with xx chain block data. \\n\\nThere are minor bugs that will be sorted out and then we\'ll be able to use it to build other tools."},{"id":"2024/11/11/xx-dapps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-11-xx-dapps.md","title":"Why dApps for xx Network","description":"Why xx Network is a great platform for private messaging dApps","date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"}],"readingTime":7.765,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/11/11/xx-dapps","title":"Why dApps for xx Network","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain"],"description":"Why xx Network is a great platform for private messaging dApps","keywords":["xx network","chain","dapp","dapps","xx chain","blockchain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dump xx Chain block contents with xxblockdumper","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-chain-block-dumper"},"nextItem":{"title":"NFT-gated access on xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access"}},"content":"- [Intro](#intro)\\n- [Building blocks](#building-blocks)\\n- [Building dApps for xx Network](#building-dapps-for-xx-network)\\n  - [Feature-full native chain](#feature-full-native-chain)\\n  - [Native currency](#native-currency)\\n- [Use cases for these building blocks](#use-cases-for-these-building-blocks)\\n- [Is that legal](#is-that-legal)\\n- [Summary](#summary)\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nAs [Hacktoberfest 2024 just finished](/blog/2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites) and I\'ve churned out some more or less coherent stuff for it, I want to share a few very short additional notes about it here.\\n\\n## Building blocks\\n\\nxx Network has a mixnet (which in turn has an SDK called xxDK) which applications use to work with cMixx.\\n\\nxx chain is a Polkadot SDK-based (aka Substrate-based) chain which has its own ecosystem, libraries, API.\\n\\nApplications can use xxDK to send messages on xx Network for free, so there\'s no need to write to xx chain or own XX coins. It is expected that only power-users [may have](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#postage) the need to buy XX coin to pay, which is to say casual use should never require anything but xxDK.\\n\\nWhat does that mean for dApp authors? I think that means xx Network is a good platform for messaging dApps. \\n\\n## Building dApps for xx Network\\n\\nUsually the fact that xx Network is \\"bootstrapped\\" in a blockchain elicits negative comments (see [these examples](/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh#techloretech)), if any at all. \\n\\nMost people have no opinion about that, which isn\'t much better. It\'s a major difference and has to be considered. If you have good reasons why being blockchain-based is bad, that\'s fine as well.\\n\\nI think it has a very positive impact that may not be obvious if you haven\'t thought about it and all you\'ve heard is \\"crypto is full of scams\\". \\n\\nFor example, I happen to think that xx Network (and the Foundation) has a better setup than Signal and their foundation. Let\'s take a look at some more practical differences between xx Network and chainless apps.\\n\\n### Feature-full native chain\\n\\nxx Network is are one of very few networks that provide anonymous messaging *and* have its own L1 chain to work with.\\n\\nxx Network has a *good* (Substrate-based), fast, low-cost chain with plenty of features - from assets to governance - so for many use cases entire apps can be written to it without using anything else. \\n\\nMost other decentralized private messaging guys have to write dApps for 3rd party chains - which we can do, too - and we do not. More choice.\\n\\nThe PoC code for [XX token- and asset-gating](/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access/) of Web sites shows how easy Polkadot-style dApps can work with xx Network - it wasn\'t too hard to modify the app for xx Network and add asset-gating. It would also be easy to modify that code to use asset-gating on other Substrate-based channels with asset support. \\n\\n### Native currency\\n\\nMost other private messaging apps don\'t have a native currency, so they have to pick a wallet and integrate with another chain. \\n\\nxxDK dApps can do that as well, but it\'s simple enough to use xx chain, especially if you need to handle postage that I mentioned earlier - in that case your app may be able to use one wallet and one currency.\\n\\nOnce XX coin gets listed on a DEX, it will be easy to acquire XX coin with any major crypto-currency and use it to pay postage (when it becomes available), so using xxDK from a dApp that defaults to other coins isn\'t any different from using other similar networks.\\n\\n## Use cases for these building blocks\\n\\nI mentioned some of them in the token-gating post, but I\'ll make one additional example here to illustrate why I worked on those \\"building blocks\\" recently - we can put them together to build some simple dApps (or semi-dApps). \\n\\n- It is easy to download a file, but if you need to do it reasonably privately, you can use [Tribler](/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler#whats-tribler)\\n  - The challenge is getting the link equally (or more) privately\\n  - Find me in my Haven Space, pay me some coins, and I\'ll seed the file for you in Tribler (and give you the link). I can automate this completely as I explained in the Hacktoberfest post, or I can make it fully manual (which is necessary for on-demand items), semi-automated, or AI-powered\\n- If you need even more privacy for downloads, you can park them on S3 and use an asset-gated Web site in the public cloud\\n- If you need even more privacy, you can run [xx Haven container and Web service on Onion network](/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not#how-it-could-be-done)\\n- If you want to use a Web3 app without using public cloud, you can create an app that uses xxDK for chat and something like Crust Network to share content\\n\\nWith XX chain (or other Substrate-chain) asset-gating we an even serve the same content using [different routes (links) for different membership levels](https://github.com/armchairancap/polkadot-js-tokengated-website/issues/2) all on xx Network.\\n\\n## Is that legal\\n\\nOf course, some will inevitably think \\"crypto is only good for scams and crime\\".\\n\\nI wouldn\'t be posting about this if I couldn\'t think of a lawful use case. \\n\\nThere are valid use cases for rare or unique data that can\'t be free (because it may require 100s of GBs in egress bandwidth).\\n\\nThere are dApps that specialize in blobs (Storj, etc.), but there are use cases where data has to be posted on demand.\\n\\nIn other cases you may not want to charge for egress in dApp, so you could use Tribler. Or you may want to speed up seeding in an ad-hoc manner, which is very easy to do in a community-powered way. Put a file on Tribler, share the link in a Haven space and ask everyone to help out:\\n- no crypto-currency involved\\n- zero barrier to entry - one free app to install (Tribler), no wallet to create, no DEX/CEX or any registration to use\\n\\nSo, it\'s not at all true there are no lawful use cases here. \\n\\nxxNetwork cMixx is used mostly to share links or other metadata that benefits from its PQE and mixnet. It could be used for paid access to low-bandwidth data feeds, but I did not consider such use cases in this post.\\n\\nLegal uses with P2P payments are also possible. In xx Network validator community there have been multiple occasions where people needed to download a copy of xx Chain faster than xx Chain could download it on its own: if you don\'t get ready by next validator election deadline you may not get elected and lose 50 XX by not validating, so paying 25 XX to get it faster would have saved validators money.\\n\\nStorj egress is $0.007/GB, so 200GB is $1.4, and about $0.8 to upload. $2.2 is still very cheap, but with some friction for both sides (Storj account setup, payment, setup).\\n\\nHaven-Tribler:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n  participant Alice\\n  participant Bob\\n  Alice->>Bob: Bob, how much to seed xx Chain block archive for 48h?\\n  Bob--\x3e>Alice: 100 XX, 10 MB/s.

Anyone with the magnet link could \\"leech\\" off Bob\'s seeding, but unless they\'re malicious they can only speed up Alice\'s download.\\n\\nWorst case: they stand up several leeching clients, making Bob\'s seeding slower. But, how could they get the magnet link if not from Alice? Because Bob used Haven to share the link to Alice, magnet links can\'t be intercepted.\\n\\nIf the attackers knew Alice was going to pay Bob for this service, they could monitor seeding announcements on Tribler and try their luck with every large archive.zip larger than 100 GB, which is easy to defeat with simple Zip file encryption.\\n:::\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nSo we have everything you need and there\'s no need to use any other network, right? \\n\\nWrong!

As if no one needs this stuff... I find that hard to believe! \\n\\nAnyway, let\'s go:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom substrateinterface import SubstrateInterface\\n\\nsubstrate = SubstrateInterface(\\n    url=\\"ws://192.168.1.30:63007\\"\\n)\\n\\n# Asset test\\nASSET_ID = 4  # asset ID: test\\nACCOUNT = \'6Xo3ESdU9nW3iiAk5ZqDA7kKqYJMcJFGiRz91LkoZKvvTjAV\' # owner / issuer\\naccount_info = substrate.query(\\n    module=\'Assets\',\\n    storage_function=\'Account\',\\n    params=[ASSET_ID, ACCOUNT],\\n)\\n\\nprint(f\'Balance: {account_info[\\"balance\\"]}\')\\n# Balance: 100000000000\\n\\n# Asset Intelligence\\nASSET_ID = 42  # asset ID: Intelligence\\nACCOUNT = \'6ZsMetbm4yoj9JQJdmhn2dKScFNkUnxULXwTBsNpmL1FM3KY\' # owner / issuer\\n\\naccount_info = substrate.query(\\n    module=\'Assets\',\\n    storage_function=\'Account\',\\n    params=[ASSET_ID, ACCOUNT],\\n)\\n\\nprint(f\'Balance: {account_info[\\"balance\\"]}\')\\n# Balance: 42\\n```\\n\\nAll right! I think this should work for other addresses (not just the owner), but I don\'t know if any of these owners have sent them to other people.\\n\\nHey, that issuance amount of `test` looks weird - how come there\'s 100000000000 of \'em when the screenshot says 100?\\n\\nThe reason is assets may have different properties. We can RTFM or try the \\"create asset\\" workflow to see what goes in.\\n\\n![xx Network asset create options](/img/blog/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access-02.png)\\n\\nSo, it appears `Intelligence` is an integer-based asset, while `test` has a crapload of decimals. \\n\\nThat\'s good to know, but it doesn\'t matter much to us in this particular workflow: we don\'t need to know how to look up an asset\'s properties as we usually accept one or more known assets. \\n\\nIf you\'re interested in that, however, find it [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/storage/#assets) - it\'s `api.query.assets.metadata` (in JavaScript). Polkadot.js API details related to assets can be found in [the repo](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/blob/9becdced121977a22c81df4d037c9d0e60b370a5/packages/types/src/interfaces/assets/definitions.ts#L1).\\n\\nIn JS I managed to do this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from \\"@polkadot/api\\";\\nimport type { StorageKey, u32 } from \'@polkadot/types\';\\nconst assetDetails = await api.query.assets.asset(assetId);\\nconsole.table(assetDetails.toHuman());\\nconst assetMetadata = await api.query.assets.metadata(assetId);\\nconsole.table(assetMetadata.toHuman());\\n```\\n... and get this.

Why? \\n\\nBecause as the author of the original comparison can\'t possibly include everything (he actually checks and compares all those details, which requires non-trivial efforts) and he focuses on major messengers so Haven\'t currently isn\'t included. (He welcomes requests, so you could suggest Haven - Haven\'t (pun intended).)\\n\\nNot having a mobile version probably doesn\'t help.\\n\\n### Wait, I can\'t run Haven on mobile?\\n\\nAs of today, yes. I mean, you *can* run Haven on mobile Android and Linux devices with WASM-capable browsers, but the UI isn\'t responsive and it doesn\'t attempt to save battery, so it won\'t be pretty.\\n\\nxx Messenger was a mobile app that would probably have done well in a comparison, but it used an older xxDK and is no longer maintained.\\n\\nHaven is the main reference application for xx Network confidential & private messaging. There\'s a patch for responsive UI which was delivered as part of Hacktoberfest 2024 activities, but it hasn\'t been merged yet. Keep an eye on that in coming weeks - if merged, that would make Haven more suitable - although just the UI - for Android browsers with WASM support.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the main topic, which is I wanted to create a post with some notes regarding the Haven column in that comparison page.\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nThese are notes that clarify some of the values I picked for the Haven column in that comparison chart.\\n\\n### Notification if contact\'s fingerprint changes\\n\\nMost people have tried Signal. If you swap your phone or such, your Signal chat counterparts will be informed that your \\"fingerprint\\" changed. There\'s no such thing on cMixx (and in Haven).\\n\\nHaven [identity](/docs/haven-user-guide/identity) *is* the only user-facing cryptographic identity. \\n\\nYou can\'t \\"\\"change\\" a fingerprint or anything like that. If you lose access to your identity (forget the password to encrypted identity file, or lose the identity file), you must assume a different identity. In that case there\'s no mechanism for you to rejoin a private Space (1-on-1 or group chat) and message contacts saying \\"this identity replaces this other identity\\". Who can tell if that\'s the same person?\\n\\nIf you have backups of the invite links and pass phrases you can rejoin those spaces using the new identity. But there\'s no way for others to know if the new identity is owned by the same person. \\n\\nThe only way to do this is to use the old identity to message everyone \\"from now on, I\'ll be using this new identity\\". \\n\\nAnother way is to use an [external identity service](https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/haven-user-guide/identity_external) where people can look up identities you claim on xx Network. But that assumes they know your external identity. \\n\\n### Find/add contacts\\n\\nSee the previous point - there\'s no name service in Haven, so you can\'t \\"find\\" anyone. \\n\\nYou can use external identity services mentioned just above.\\n\\nxx Messenger [had this custom IDs](https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/idCollisionAndNotifications), but Haven does not. Personally I don\'t miss those - I think external ID services are the way to go because messenger contacts are just one of many things you need to have an address book for. \\n\\nSince Haven is one of few messengers that is anchored in a blockchain, knowing someone\'s cMixx name is not enough. We want their wallet addresses (probably not just for xx coin, but for several currencies), their ENS name, and other public Web3 data they choose to publish. \\n\\nWhy you can\'t \\"add\\" contacts either? Well, we\'d need to sync them somewhere. xx Messenger could upload (backup) its data to S3, so contacts could be saved as well. \\n\\nxx Haven currently doesn\'t do that so contacts must be searched in external services where people publish their Haven identities. That location is a matter of choice as well - not just in terms of usability, but also privacy, cost, and more. Having to publish your data on ENS (and pay that fee) may or may not be liked by all users which is why I think Haven should leave those integrations to other cMixx messengers when they appear. I don\'t mind looking it up in whatever way is convenient for me and my contacts.\\n\\n### Supported push notification services\\n\\nxx Messenger used a centralized push service, but Haven doesn\'t currently doesn\'t have it which means it\'s limited to constant polling which is power-consuming. \\n\\nThat doesn\'t matter much for desktops (there\'s more \\"unnecessary\\" activity from [Cover Traffic](https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/coverTraffic) than from notifications), but matters on mobile devices. \\n\\n### Legal jurisdication\\n\\nThe xx Foundation is a non-profit in the USA.\\n\\nMixnet round scheduling is done by the Foundation and that server is - if I\'m not mistaken - in located the EU. The scheduling node isn\'t involved in data handling.\\n\\nClient-side ecrypted user data has five copies per each cMixx round and so user data from each conversation lives in dozens of jurisdications (see [the cMix dashboard](https://dashboad.xx.network)). The scheduling server doesn\'t know which messages went into which mixnet round - only the sender and recepient(s) do, so those not included in a conversation wouldn\'t even know where encrypted data is.\\n\\nEncrypted data is kept on cMixx gateways for 21 days after which only local (cached) copies may remain on participants\' clients.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI obviously don\'t speak for the author of the original document, so the values I picked for Haven are my own.\\n\\nThis post elaborates on all the rows where I felt felt sharing some notes would be helpful. If the original author reviews and adds Haven to his document, I may or may not update my fork (I wouldn\'t if I completely disagreed with this evaluation, for example).\\n\\nI have some other comparisons in other blog entries - you can search the site for \\"comparison\\" to find them."},{"id":"2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-01-my-hacktober-activities.md","title":"Good Hacktoberfest 2024","description":"My Hacktoberfest 2024 activities","date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":1.38,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites","title":"Good Hacktoberfest 2024","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"My Hacktoberfest 2024 activities","keywords":["xx network","xx chain","tribler","haven","decentralized","hacktoberfest","hacktoberfest 2024"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Notes on forked comparison of messengers","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes"},"nextItem":{"title":"xx Haven with Tribler","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler"}},"content":"[Hacktoberfest 2024](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is over so here\'s what I did:\\n\\n- Added search function, keywords and front matter to 67 pages on [https://learn.xx.network/](https://learn.xx.network/).

I think there is: one UI with Haven and Tribler:\\n\\n- Someone posts RSS feed into a private (or public) Haven Space (\\"chat channel\\")\\n- Users copy links and download them using Tribler \\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nIdeally, Haven could run inside of Tribler. But the Tribler project would have to make that happen. Alternatively, someone could create and maintain a patch. Not very good.\\n\\nAnother way is to create a small patch to Tribler menus and run Haven in an iFrame.\\n\\nAnother way is to run Tribler in a Haven iFrame. That\'s easier, but you have to create a small patch for Haven, which some privacy-sensitive people may not like.\\n\\n### Pros and cons of DIY approaches\\n\\nA Haven iFrame in Tribler chat menu is available [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-tribler-haven/releases/tag/v1.0). I call this attempt v1.0. \\n\\nYou click on the chat cloud icion and Haven opens in the main pane (iFrame).\\n\\n![Tribler with a Haven iFrame](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/tribler-with-haven-iframe.png)\\n\\n- Step 1: join a Haven Space (\\"chat channel\\")\\n- Step 2: find a magnet link\\n- Step 3: paste it into \\"Add torrent\\" \\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in\\n\\nDo you see what I mean? If your use case is \\"get into a Haven Space, get one link, copy it to Tribler and leave Haven\\", this is actually a good approach. All it takes to secure access to Haven is to navigate away: you won\'t leave Haven iFrame open because in order to use that Magnet link you\'ll have to leave it. Just make sure your Haven profile password is strong!\\n\\nNote that this only hides your Haven identity, Spaces, and chat data, while Tribler UI is still running and downloaded data is on disk. \\n\\nThe second approach I tried - a Tribler iFrame in Haven - works the other way around, except there\'s no state in Tribler (it\'s a server-based application with a Web UI) so if you download multiple torrents or like to chat with Space members as you download, this may be better for you. \\n\\n![Haven with a Tribler iFrame](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/haven-with-tribler-iframe.png)\\n\\nJoin a channel, get your links, download them in Tribler and watch/manage downloads as they go.\\n\\nIn this approach there\'s a small patch to Haven which seems low-risk to me if you\'re the only user of your Haven instance: you own the Haven instance and you own the Tribler instance as well, so as long as you\'re not concerned about Tribler in a Haven iFrame, I think patching Haven and using it this way is fine.\\n\\nI\'m working on finalizing these small patches in another release at the same location as v1.0.\\n\\n### Do we actually need any integration?\\n\\nThat\'s a good question. If you don\'t use both of these applications at the same time often, it\'s probably best to use them separately and avoid complications.\\n\\nAs an example of yet other approaches, I\'ve built a simple browser extension which downloads selected (Magnet) links using Tribler: very easy to use, no patches required. But you can\'t see or control what\'s going on with downloads without going to another tab or window with Tribler UI. \\n\\nI couldn\'t load Haven in this \\"preview\\" version of Firefox (WASM issues), but this is how simple the extension is: select a Magnet link in Haven chat and use the extension to initiate Tribler download.\\n\\n![Download with Tribler Extension](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/haven-with-browser-extension.png)\\n\\nThis can work anywhere including the \\"Haven with a Tribler iFrame\\" approach because it simply talks to the Tribler API and Tribler UI doesn\'t need to be visible. It saves some copy-and-paste even if Tribler runs in the same browser tab as Haven. I\'ve posted a proof-of-concept version [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/magnet-link-downloader-tribler-firefox) - see the link for the details.\\n\\nIf you\'re a security freak, I won\'t try to persuade you to use these iFrame approaches.\\n\\n## Security concerns\\n\\nIt is possible that the app in iFrame does something to its parent frame. If you worry about that, of course just run the apps separately or even in different VMs.\\n\\nIn the \\"Haven with a Tribler iFrame\\" approach we could tighten the iFrame CORS, and also properly integrate applications so that we don\'t have to skip authentication from `localhost` clients on Tribler (which I currently do). I\'ll post the patches in the repo for easy reviewing. Risk of someone else accessing your instance of Tribler on `localhost` (where Haven is running) through Haven iFrame should be extremely low, though. \\n\\nAnd this instance of Tribler should not listen on public IPs - simply close off its Web UI and IP ports.\\n\\nIf you want to let others access Haven on the same computer, you could simply start another container binding a public IP and port. The same goes for extra Tribler instances.\\n\\nIn a crazy mix-up setup you could run a \\"groupware edition\\" of Haven-Tribler compose.yaml:\\n\\n- Haven-Tribler setup for multiple users (who all share same Tribler and can be in the same channel if they\'re all focused on same content)\\n- One Web server gateway sharing static content (Tribler download directory) for authenticated downloads\\n\\nThat would be as secure as the stupidest downloader.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nHaven provides private and confidential access to Magnet links that can be used in Tribler: free access, post-quantum E2EE, and metadata shredding eliminate the need to use Tor, VPNs or privacy-leaking Web sites.\\n\\nAmong DIY approaches at lightweight integration:\\n\\n- For single-torrent and one-off use, Tribler with a Haven iFrame is a good approach which forces inconvenience (and results in good SecOps)\\n- For parallel use (Haven + Tribler) and multiple downloads, I like Haven with a Tribler iFrame because it gives me full control over Tribler\\n- For \\"hidden Tribler\\" we can run Haven + browser extension that hooks into the Tribler API, but you\'d want extra controls and visibility into downloads, which means either occasional access to Tribler UI or a fat extension with some Tribler indicators similar to \\"Down Them All\\" or such (which is complex)."},{"id":"2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-13-bip-utils-with-xx-network.md","title":"Use BIP39 from bip-utils with xx Network","description":"How to use bip-utils with xx network","date":"2024-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":0.865,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","title":"Use BIP39 from bip-utils with xx Network","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"How to use bip-utils with xx network","keywords":["xx network","xx chain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Haven with Tribler","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler"},"nextItem":{"title":"A comparison between Nym and xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork"}},"content":"## bip-utils\\n\\n[bip-utils](https://github.com/ebellocchia/bip_utils) allows generating mnemonics, seeds, private/public keys and addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies, including Substrate-based currencies.\\n\\n## xx Network support\\n\\nI added it to a fork [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/bip_utils_xx/commit/6b15ab0d26aa8a75238a1047336e82e1549c79bc).

You may want to do your own comparison vs. Mullvad VPN or other VPN service.\\n\\n### Blockchain\\n\\nThis isn\'t important for end users, but Polkadot (used by xx Network) has a bigger ecosystem compared to Cosmos.\\n\\nGovernance and integrations seem better on Polkadot and that\'s why it\'s been relatively easy for xx Network to create integrations (bridge) with Ripple and Ethereum, for example. I expect this will continue simply because xx Network leverages a superior blockchain platform (Polkadot).\\n\\n### Validators\\n\\nNym is still running a permissioned network that\'s smaller than xx Network\'s. In this regard, they\'re behind.\\n\\nPerhaps out of necessity, Nym has a more restricted entry and exit conditions for validators. I actually like how they do this and I think it\'s better than xx Network. Highlights:\\n\\n> New validators can join via a NYM-to-NYX swap contract. The contract will not allow more than 1% of total stake increase per month to prevent sudden hostile takeovers.\\n\\n> The contract will only allow swapping NYM to NYX and will not allow exchanging NYX back to NYM. A NYX holder who wishes to sell their NYX stake will have to do so via OTC trades.\\n\\nYou may say this doesn\'t prevent indirect hoarding of coins, but at least at this moment (because the network is permissioned with KYC, it appears) they can control this better. xx Network has some small pools that should be banned from the network, but the problem probably isn\'t significant enough to motivate the community to move against it.\\n\\nxx Network is permissionless as far as staking and identity are concerned. So, although Nym\'s rules and controls seem helpful, they may not be possible to implement on xx Network or a permissionless Nym network. We\'ll see how Nym adjusts to permissionless life (if they ever get there).\\n\\n### Services\\n\\nNym provides a Wireguard-based VPN routed over their network, which xx Network doesn\'t do. \\n\\nWhile this seems great - you don\'t need to buy Mullvad or other VPN subscription, for example - it\'s a trap. \\n\\nNot for the users, but for Nym Tech and their community whose nodes provide that service. \\n\\nI don\'t think they\'ll be able to pull this off because bandwidth requirements will be huge and there\'s no way operators who operate VPN entry/exit nodes can do that with residential connections. What does that mean?\\n\\nThat means SPs or the cloud, and that means they\'ll need to be paid.\\n\\nBut, now you have KYC + getting paid for VPN + risk of illegal use (which they can\'t really monitor because it\'s encrypted and censorship-free). Do you see where this is going? \\n\\nDo you want to make $500/mo and deal with daily DMCA notices and maybe even police inquiries? Not many people do, unless they\'re based in a 3rd world country.\\n\\nI don\'t know how they\'re going to pull that off. If I was them I\'d allow only whitelisted destinations, but for most of those people don\'t really need to use VPNs. \\n\\nWe\'ll see. I\'m skeptical.\\n\\n### Integrations\\n\\nI haven\'t done a deep dive on these, but:\\n\\n- Nym is ahead in VPN-related integrations simply because there\'s not much to integrate and xx Network doesn\'t have that integration to begin with\\n- Mixnet integrations are hard to compare because they\'re dissimilar and each platform has a few so maybe it\'s fair to say it\'s roughly even\\n\\nxx Network has wallet integrations through Proxxy (cMix-backed API proxy), while Nym\'s own wallet natively uses Nym\'s mixnet (and they have Zk-nyms), so in wallet integrations they\'re likely better.\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nxx Network doesn\'t have blockchain privacy features. This decision was deliberate - I wrote about it [here](/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view).\\n\\nNym has zk-nyms which makes it a privacy-capable coin and therefore a candidate for delisting (or harder listing) on centralized exchanges. \\n\\nIf you need a VPN, you can get Mullvad VPN and pay with Monero. If you\'re a Nym VPN user, then it appears you can buy Nym VPN credits with Zcash.\\n\\nBoth approaches work, but with Nym you can buy both VPN and pay for mixnet services with one coin. Now you may say \\"I prefer Monero and Mullvad\\", but that\'s a matter of preference and convenience.\\n\\nxx coin, the native currency of xx chain, may add privacy features in the future but it\'s been de-prioritized to avoid regulatory and listing challenges. \\n\\nOne valid point in Nym\'s material is that you can acquire their coin and pay for services without being tracked. xx Network can\'t do that. At the same time, xx Network cMix service is still free, so there\'s nothing to pay for. You still *don\'t need* any xx coin to use xx Network in the first place!\\n\\n### Mixnet \\n\\nFirst, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a to-do item for Nym, and implemented in xx Network\'s cMix. \\n\\nSecond, Nym\'s network is still centralized, so every single validator is known. Said differently: Nym mixing is decentralized, but all the mixers are known.\\n\\nThird, in their [litepaper](https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf), they have a comparison between cMix (mixnet used by xx Network) and their modified 3rd party design (based on [Loopix](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-piotrowska.pdf)). I\'m not qualified to evaluate that, so I won\'t. \\n\\nAnd then there\'s this thing below. As a reminder: their litepaper was published (updated?) in 2023, so it\'s not like they\'ve missed anything because it didn\'t exist in mid 2023. \\n\\nIn the table below they refer to Elixxir (which was the company behind xx Network/cMix early on) although xx Network has become foundation-managed years ago and Elixxir no long plays a role. Maybe using a prehistoric name is a way to say \\"we created that in 2019 and forgot to update\\". Well, you didn\'t and your litepaper was published on Nov 2, 2023. \\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-08-20-nym-vs-cmix.png)\\n\\nLet\'s see:\\n\\n- **1 - Incentivised relays** - xx Network has had that for years. Validators stake themselves and get staked by other coin holders. They get rewarded for authoring blocks on xx chain and relaying cMix messages. [In coming quarters](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage/) postage for premium tier users.\\n- **2 - Scalable network** - xx Network has almost 400 nodes - more than enough for its traffic needs - and it doesn\'t seem not scalable (or whatever is the opposite from scalable). For a mixnet focused on short messages (whether it\'s text messages or API calls), it seems scalable enough to me.\\n- **3 - Secure and efficient encryption protocol** - As I\'ve mentioned earlier Nym claims their approach has a higher efficiency which I am unable to judge, but they don\'t have post-quantum encryption so even it it\'s more efficient, is it more secure across the board? It\'s a blanket statement. Not to mention that xx Network\'s cMix was developed in-house by Dr. Chaum and is still being developed (this includes development for [three Worldcoin grants](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage)), while Nym\'s is a modified implementation of a 3rd party invention.\\n- **4 - Community governance of the relay nodes** - xx Network has had this for years and Polkadot has better governance features than Cosmos.\\n- **5 - Large anonymity set** - xx Network currently uses 5 nodes and most messages generally delivered within 3 seconds (see Real Time (round) component in the [xx Network dashboard](https://dashboard.xx.network) - mean 24h latency is currently 2.12s). That seems enough for the use cases targeted by xx Network (chat, API proxy, voting, etc.), and can be increased. I don\'t know how large (it\'s not in the litepaper and I didn\'t try very hard to find that information elsewhere) Nym\'s anonymity sets are, so this advantage isn\'t quantified and doesn\'t appear significant for xx Network use cases. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNym has some advantages, but they\'re behind in terms of development - fully permissioned chain, no PQC and with legal challenges ahead of them.\\n\\nVPNs are cool, but it\'s also just bulk traffic - porn, Torrents and crap of that nature. Not that we don\'t need that too, but it\'s a saturated and legally sensitive market (copyright violations, illegal content, etc). Due to the high cost of comparatively enormous bandwidth required for VPNs, it will be a very tough use case to monetize. And Nym Tech has bills to pay.\\n\\nDr. Chaum\'s decisions to not create a privacy coin and to focus on specific (and high-value) use cases such as messaging and voting were in hindsight perfect. The choice of blockchain platform (Polkadot/Substrate) - whether due to luck or wisdom or a combination of both - also seems better than Nym\'s Cosmos, so I expect less hurdles and faster progress with xx Network\'s Web3 integrations.\\n\\nPersonally I\'m comfortable with design choices, target markets and other details of xx Network.\\n\\nNym looks like a decent platform, but they\'ve made some less than ideal choices."},{"id":"2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-16-worldcoin-xx-postage.md","title":"Worldcoin and xx Network postage","description":"Thoughts on Worldcoin integrations and xx Network postage","date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":10.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage","title":"Worldcoin and xx Network postage","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"Thoughts on Worldcoin integrations and xx Network postage","keywords":["xx network","economics","worldcoin","cmix","postage"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A comparison between Nym and xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork"},"nextItem":{"title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh"}},"content":"**DISCLAIMER:** this is not investment advice. I\'ve no idea what will happen and I don\'t recommend anything.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nxx Network has been around for years and has users, but not very many because:\\n\\n- many Web3 and coin projects suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome ([example](http://localhost:3000/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not))\\n- many projects don\'t know about xx Network\\n- several smart projects know and appreciate xx Network but they\'re are still in the process of integrating with xx Network (or the other way around)\\n\\nWorldcoin is one of those smart projects in \\"the other way around\\" situation - xx Network is creating integrations for Worldcoin and this is work in progress (and progressing well).\\n\\nSpecifically, there are three Worldcoin Foundation grants that were awarded to xx Network-affiliated developers. You can read or listen about it in this interesting interview with [one of the developers](https://patcrypt.com/worldcoin-xx-network-collaboration-interview-with-mario-yaksetig/).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Worldcoin is doing their thing. Today I saw [this](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-mimos-partnership-bring-digital-proof-humanness-malaysia):\\n\\n> MIMOS Berhad, the applied research and development arm of the Malaysian Government, has signed an MoU with the Worldcoin Foundation, Tools for Humanity (TFH) and MyEG, a leading e-government services provider, to integrate Worldcoin technology into the country\u2019s digital infrastructure.\\n\\n> The intent of the MoU is to leverage the Worldcoin protocol and TFH technologies to improve ongoing and future work related to digital credentials. In doing so, it validates the importance of digital proof of humanness in the age of AI.\\n\\nHmm, wait, how many people live in Malaysia? 34 million. \\n\\nWhoa - xx coin will go to the moon!!! \\n\\nNo, it won\'t. But fine - let\'s talk about postage!\\n\\n## Postage\\n\\nI\'ve blogged about \\"postage\\", which is how xx Network plans to charge for its Premium tier suitable for power users. \\n\\nWhere will the collected postage go? Mostly to the validators - server operators on xx Network - and (if I recall correctly) part of it goes to the xx Foundation.\\n\\nDoes that mean that the price of xx coin will moon? Of course not.\\n\\nWe don\'t know if those Worldcoin apps in Malaysia will actually be released. It\'s just an MoU.\\n\\nEven if they make it, we don\'t know if they\'ll *choose* to use Worldcoin\'s privacy features that rely on xx Network. The Malaysian integrators *could* choose to not use them at all and I\'d say this may be the most likely outcome in this particular country.\\n\\nWe don\'t know how many apps will be developed, and how frequently they\'ll be used. \\n\\nWe also don\'t know if the apps will *need* access to Premium tier. Each individual user probably won\'t need it and postage measures access by each individual user. An app can have 5 million users and as long as each sends or receives several messages per minute, none of them will need to pay postage.\\n\\nAre the chances of Worldcoin apps using xx Network\'s Premium tier nil, then?\\n\\n## Why pay postage\\n\\nWhile only a very small percentage of Worldcoin (or other platform\'s) users will require access to Premium (or \\"unlimited\\" aka \\"best effort\\") tier, anyone who charges for their application or service or wants to prevent *another* paying user (or all the free users) from hogging them out, may want to ask users to subscribe to the Premium tier if it\'s affordable enough.\\n\\nI\'m not making this up to spread the idea that massive demand for xx coin is inevitable or just around the corner. \\n\\nWhat I\'m saying is I expect postage will be inexpensive enough to be purchased for \\"just in case\\" situations.\\n\\nWhen you think about it, that\'s almost the opposite from \\"xx coin will moon\\" - the idea here isn\'t to create scarcity and get rich off the appreciating xx coin. On the contrary!\\n\\nThe way markets work is: if you want more of something, you pay for it just enough to make the seller willing to satisfy that demand.\\n\\nIf xx Network\'s message mixing service (cMix) works well for you, there\'s no \\"reason\\" to pay anything. (But you have the option to donate to the Foundation if so inclined).\\n\\nBut the presence of a Free Tier also means that everyone gets the same rights. \\n\\nSomeone can stand up 500 containers in AWS and spam the network all day long just because. Or simply try to freeload as much as possible.\\n\\nIf this happens at scale, quality of service as experienced by Free tier users may be impacted.\\n\\nIf you are getting paid for the app you sell or rely on xx Network at scale, then it may be wise to avoid such congestions where a busy day for Free tier users translates into a busy day for your Support staff. It\'s better to pay some postage just in case of accidental or malicious congestions.\\n\\nAs users pay for Postage, decentralized nodes that participate on the network (\\"validators\\") earn more xx coins which means more nodes can come online without diluting any node\'s daily earnings and at the same time improves network throughput. \\n\\nDemand for xx coin may result in its price going up, but I would not expect significant impacts from demand for postage because as long as *similar* services exist, no one will pay 3x premium for xx Network. They may pay a 10% or even 110% more, but not for very long.\\n\\nIn addition to this \\"just in case I need it\\" scenario, there may be high volume users who prefer to use Premium tier on a regular basis.\\n\\nA power user who sends thousands of messages every day (example: IoT feed or remote camera that chunks images into many \\"text\\" messages) could set up multiple identities to stay within the Free tier limit, or make his life simpler and pay a small premium for 1-2 thousand messages above the cut-off message limit for the Premium tier.\\n\\nHow will postage work? You may view a draft of high-level design for v1.0 features [here](https://patcrypt.com/plans-for-postage-v1-announced/).\\n\\nAs you can see in that document, users will also be throttled per smaller units of time, so that no one can overload the network by exhausting their daily quota within 15 minutes. \\n\\nWe can also see that in v1.0 there will be no \\"reserved capacity\\" which some users would probably like to have. Examples:\\n\\n- Elections: with 5 million voters and (only) 3 hours to vote, you may want to prepay for 600 messages per second during voting hours on the election day. xx Network would then lower its Free tier throughput from (let\'s say) 7 to 5 messages per client per minute and drop total Free tier throughput per second by 600 messages per second. But this isn\'t easy. We may need smart contracts (to reserve time) which Polkadot SDK has, but xx Network hasn\'t yet activated on its Substrate-based xx chain. And there\'s another problem: speculators could front-run legitimate buyers as election dates are known in advance and often hard-coded in legislative acts\\n- Any user with \\"guaranteed minimum\\" requirements. Even if you need to send just 1 message per minute (which well within the Free tier - there\'s 1,440 minutes in a day) - you may want to pay postage in order to able to send at least one message per minute\\n\\nWhen you consider all these niche scenarios, it\'s easy to see how this gets complicated quickly. I\'ve no idea what\'s the best way to go about it in Postage v2 or later, but for thousands of users with custom requirements, Smart Contracts maybe the way to go as all mixing nodes can easily look them up on xx chain. \\n\\n## Node operators and permissionless postage\\n\\nIf you need guaranteed throughput for your clients, you can strike a deal whereby an operator gives you a dedicated, guaranteed fraction of their node\'s connections. You\'d have to approach them on xx Network Discord and so on, but in theory that\'s possible.\\n\\nNo one needs to know, you get guaranteed throughput when everyone else may be timing out while connecting to xx Network gateways. Can that be done?\\n\\nNot for very many messages and users, but it\'s certainly viable for either Free or Premium tiers. I can reserve 10kB/s for your client IP or throttle everyone else but your IP, for example.\\n\\nAny node operator could make such side deals on their own for users *who don\'t mind to always connect to the same gateways*. That decreases user\'s privacy, so that\'s a trade-off which may or may not matter.\\n\\nAnother trade-off is if the network is overloaded, that node may be able to accept your messages just fine, but still unable to complete mixing them with other (random) groups of nodes out there, so it\'s not guaranteed to work in terms of actually sending messages. \\n\\nI conclude this would be possible but not very valuable for either the node operators (\\"validators\\") or users. The Premium Tier is expected to be cheap enough to make these laborious workarounds unnecessary and unattractive financially, technically, and privacy-wise. \\n\\nOne use case for this may be local elections, where the government stands up 3-4 nodes and limits access to in-country IPs. As noted above that would impact - maybe even compromise (I\'m not qualified to tell) - privacy, but not the integrity of messages (protected by PQC), but it would also make DDoS attacks on that day much harder to execute - any in-country IP addresses could be shut down in minutes, while foreign IP addresses wouldn\'t be allowed to connect to those gateway nodes. I can\'t estimate the impact of this approach so I wouldn\'t recommend it, but there may be similar use cases where having your own node on the network could be beneficial.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nI don\'t expect Worldcoin\'s integrations in Malaysia will result in much demand on xx Network *when* postage becomes available. For Malaysia, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the government mandated that all Worldcoin-integrated apps include various gov-mandated data gathering add-ons.\\n\\nBut what excites me is that similar integrations will sooner or later happen in some other country. A Worldcoin-integrating app developer *may* also choose to enable xxNetwork-related privacy features. If that sounds unlikely to you, please see the interview with Mario and the voting integration (one of the three grants). Even Malaysia may want to enable anonymity in a Worldcoin voting app and disable it in other domestic Worldcoin applications.\\n\\nPostage v1.0 may not be able to satisfy all use cases right away. DoS-style attacks by sock-puppet accounts could cause issues even to users of the Premium tier, but xx Network has world-class developers who are no doubt aware of all these things and will make recommendations related to privacy, security, performance and reliability expectations.\\n\\nPostage v1.0 may become available a few months from now and it is one of the features essential for monetization of xx Network\'s mixing services.\\n\\nOther apps rely on donations, subscriptions, or may be VC-backed and don\'t need to charge just yet. \\n\\nxx Network is integrated with a blockchain service and very unique in that regard. Rewards - and later postage - are sent and received on a blockchain. For messaging, servers that pass and mix messages are operated by individuals from many countries and they\'re currently rewarded for their \\"mixing\\", but there\'s only a free tier so rewards aren\'t as impactful and demand for coins is lower because there aren\'t real life use cases for it. Postage will improve and better align users\' and operators\' incentives.\\n\\nMy take:\\n\\n- Worldcoin in Malaysia won\'t make xx coin \\"go to the moon\\"\\n- Benefits of xx Network integrations with Worldcoin are real. Potential for adoption is real. When the first integrated implementation happens xx Network traffic could see a significant increase\\n- All other apps that use xx Network as \\"transport\\" could use Premium tier, but currently Worldcoin seems to be the most significant integration. \\n- Postage won\'t make xx Network expensive to use. It will make xx Network deliver more value\\n- Until there\'s a way to *reserve* throughput, apps with high reliability expectations should have a way to fallback to Tor or direct access when uptime is more precious than privacy"},{"id":"2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-06-xx-network-updates-cryptographic-primitives.md","title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","description":"xx Network client replaces SIDH with CTIDH","date":"2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":15.915,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"xx Network client replaces SIDH with CTIDH","keywords":["xx network","pq","post-quantum","encryption","client","CTIDH","SIDH","ENS","postage","xx messenger","phoenixx","cmix"],"image":"/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Worldcoin and xx Network postage","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage"},"nextItem":{"title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [CTIDH](#ctidh)\\n- [Why xx Network developers picked the vulnerable SIDH](#why-xx-network-developers-picked-the-vulnerable-sidh)\\n- [But, *where* is this xx Messenger?](#but-where-is-this-xx-messenger)\\n- [Timelines and additional sources (some of disinformation)](#timelines-and-additional-sources-some-of-disinformation)\\n  - [Signal CEO](#signal-ceo)\\n  - [techlore.tech](#techloretech)\\n    - [Techlore discussion forum tip](#techlore-discussion-forum-tip)\\n- [xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good](#xx-chain-scam-signal-phone-numbers-good)\\n- [Take-aways](#take-aways)\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI\'m not a cryptography expert, so all I can do is rehash information from trusted sources (and you may verify it if you wish). \\n\\nWhat value does rehashing content that I myself can\'t verify add?

Used to combine Diffie\u2013Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.\\n- HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.\\n- Diffie\u2013Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.\\n\\nNote that the page still mentions SIDH for PQ and below that is a note that it was replaced by CTIDH is below it. This is so that if you have a client with an older build, you know that you should use a newer client if you care about latest PQ encryption.\\n\\n## Why xx Network developers picked the vulnerable SIDH\\n\\nThey didn\'t.\\n\\nxx Network picked SIDH at the time it was *not* known to be vulnerable and they did it because it was evaluated and found to be suitable. \\n\\nOne reason particularly stands out to me because it alone - given that SIDH used to be recommended by experts in the field - made it very desirable for use in PQ private messaging.\\n\\n> the primary reason is the key sizes as they fit into a single packet\\n\\nSource: [xx Network forum](https://forum.xx.network/t/paper-an-efficient-key-recovery-attack-on-sidh-preliminary-version-affects-xx-messenger-quantum-security/6835/3)\\n\\nAs you can see the SIDH vulnerability paper was published *after* xx Messenger was released.\\n\\nYou can read that entire thread for additional information and context, including this part:\\n\\n> This has **no impact on the privacy of cMix**.\\n\\n## But, *where* is this xx Messenger?\\n\\nIt came out early and it used xx Network in a way that\'s not efficient by current xx Network standards (now the recommended way is [xxDK](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/xxdk-wasm)).\\n\\nAs direction of development changed towards a less generic, more Web3-oriented applications, xx Messenger wasn\'t updated, but it was still considered not at risk and it wasn\'t promoted either. It would have needed total overhaul (front-end for Web3, back-end for xxDK) and while the source code is still available, the application itself was pulled (or allowed to expire, I\'m not sure) on iOS. I haven\'t checked for Android.\\n\\n[Phoenixx.io](https://phoenixx.io) has been developing a modern mobile-compatible client for cMix network. It\'s supposed to come out in H2 of 2024 and a beta desktop version has been available for a while.\\n\\n## Timelines and additional sources (some of disinformation)\\n\\nAgain, for discoverability and curation, I want to share a few more links. \\n\\n### Signal CEO\\n\\nSignal was the first PQ messenger. That\'s according to Signal, as you can see in this [piece of fake news](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1761279358319366506) by the Signal CEO:\\n\\n![Signal CEO says theirs is the first PQ messaging application](/img/blog/2024-06-06-signal-first-pq-fake-news.png)\\n\\n- Source: [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/signal-adds-quantum-resistant-encryption-to-its-e2ee-messaging-protocol/)\\n\\n- Fact: xx Messenger came out [in late January 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220125171829/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220125005773/en/Private-Messaging-App-Launches-on-Quantum-Resistant-Decentralized-xx-network)\\n- Fact: SIDH key recovery attack paper received by publisher [on July 30, 2022](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975)\\n\\n> January 25, 2022 10:30 AM Eastern Standard Time\\n> LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The world\u2019s first quantum-resistant messaging app, xx messenger, launched on the xx network today.\\n\\nThe above is just FYI - don\'t mention this to any open-minded people like those who run Techlore.tech. \\n\\n### techlore.tech\\n\\nI\'ve said at the top that I can\'t post a simple comment on CTIDH update where I\'d like to. I meant I\'d like to visit techlore.tech and share an update.\\n\\nI\'ll use this post to say a few words about that community of independent thinkers. \\n\\nLast February I head over there, register and, in a topic related to Wickr alternatives, mention **two** applications that use xx Network\'s cMix (not just xx Messenger):\\n\\n- Speakeasy/Haven - as a modern (xxDK mentioned above) version but not yet for mobile\\n- xx Messenger - as a mobile app that (at the time) was still available on iOS\\n\\nSince I\'m following xx Network closely, I *know* that xx Messenger isn\'t maintained, I know *why* (for the reasons explained above), so I mention that Phoenixx.io plans to launch a modern mobile messenger and that Speakeasy may also become available for mobile.\\n\\nBut, in one comment I make a mistake and cite that false statement by the Signal CEO and also say that Signal *has* metadata that has been disclosed to law enforcement and assist in identifying users (not the content of Signal messages). A minor mistake - which I admitted and rephrased - was that I said that Signal had in the past disclosed users\' IP addresses, but of course they wouldn\'t do that as law enforcement comes to them asking about the use of Signal (they likely already have users\' IP address). I stick to the statement that metadata had been disclosed and that IP addresses *could* be as well.\\n\\nMembers and the owner respond with dismissive comments, insults, accusations and foul language.\\n\\nGuy nicknamed TechFounder [goes first](https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=site%3adiscuss.techlore.tech+%22xx+network%22&d=4678435270362092&mkt=en-WW&setlang=en-US&w=CQQ_JiUp0zhPgYEILFIgyomLftTED_lL):\\n\\n> Where\u2019s their Post-Quantum encryption documentation? Has it been auditied (sic!)/proven it actually protects against those attacks?\\n\\nGee, indeed, where could it be possibly found? Maybe by searching the Internet for \'xx Network\' or \'xx Messenger\'? \\n\\n> You didn\u2019t provide anything useful for anyone, just for your ego saying that your obscure messenger it\u2019s better than Signal when it clearly isn\u2019t.\\n\\nI suspect that\'s what triggered them: I pointed out that the big news about Signal being the first with PQ was really a piece of fake news since xx Messenger (and possibly other) PQ messengers have been out there for a while. I did *not* claim xx Messenger was better at all. \\n\\nShe didn\'t say Signal was the first *major* PQ messenger and it wasn\'t on X/Twitter - her statement was posted on Mastodon - so she wasn\'t limited by the maximum number of characters per post so that she couldn\'t qualify her statement. To me, that\'s a problem and simply pointing that out ought to be useful to the community because it says something about the person who runs that shop. Not that she\'s compromised or anything that bad, but if you can\'t trust 100% of what a person says, it may be the time to start scrutinizing every word that comes out of their mouth.\\n\\nOne may say it\'s an innocent mistake despite not being limited by word count on X - one word less or more, what\'s the big deal? She\'s not a semi-literate, misspelling computer geek familiar with only computer languages. She [knows better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker#Early_life_and_education).\\n\\n> Whittaker completed her bachelor\'s **degree in rhetoric** at University of California, Berkeley\\n\\nOr maybe she was indeed precise and accurately stated that Signal was the first to add PQ encryption to Signal. xx Network was the first to add it to xx Messenger. Everyone is right!!!\\n\\nAnd what about TechFounder\'s obscurity comment? Of course, what can possibly be more obscure to people actively engaged in cryptography and privacy than work of Dr. Chaum?\\n\\nBut not everyone at Techlore.tech is incompetent and dismissive. Another user - Karner - obviously performed due diligence. Their expert opinion:\\n\\n> You\u2019re referring to an obscure blockchain-based scam-based messaging platform that has no users and uses a broken cryptosystem (SIDH)\u2026\\n\\nAll right, I\'m promoting scams which I guess makes me a scammer (or a useful idiot at best). That\'s a promising line of attack against my claim that xx Messenger was PQ before Signal!\\n\\nNever mind that I didn\'t even mention xx coin. But now that I am blogging on my personal blog everyone can check my X posts (tweets) and blog posts here and easily find dozens of occurrences where I encouraged and invited people to \\"invest\\" in xx coin and all the claims it\'s going to moon. Good luck with that!\\n\\nAlso never mind that although SIDH - one of the pieces in that stack - was found to be vulnerable, xx developers estimated cMix was still fine.\\n\\nThen [ThiccRaiden](https://discuss./t/wickr-messaging-is-no-longer-available-as-of-31-12-2023/6576) (claims to accept any pronouns in his/her/their profile - must be very nice, I thought) says to me:\\n\\n> You join the forum, literally make shit up and then backpedal to \u2018well it\u2019s hypothetically possible,\u2019 while promoting a random messaging app\\n\\n(The stuff I \\"made up\\" was the IP misstatement mentioned earlier, which I rephrased and which didn\'t impact the validity of my claim about Signal\'s access to that metadata - they may not *retain* it, but they do have it, as does AWS.)\\n\\nI respond to ThiccRaiden\'s rude message by saying that I don\'t care about the rudeness, but I won\'t respond in kind and if the site owner moderates, they should apply the same rules to all members.\\n\\nBy now I\'ve been called a scammer, poster of useless information (spammer?), and liar. What a hearty, warm welcome!\\n\\nThe site owner completely ignores all that and doubles down on ThiccRaiden\'s message of ignorance and FUD:\\n\\n> the Android App hasn\u2019t been updated since August of 2022. Not touching this with a 50ft pole. \\n\\nLet\'s unpack that:\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is obscure**. False. It wasn\'t a Tier 1 - let\'s say it wasn\'t even Tier 2 - messaging application, but that doesn\'t matter. It was very likely the first PQ messenger, by early 2024 it was out there with PQ for years before other \\"alternatives to Wickr\\", cMix that it uses was created by some of the top people in the field and we know it wasn\'t obscure because the app had many downloads. Not only are/were there cMix messaging apps in ongoing development, but application interfaces are being implemented for \\"application messages\\" from other projects as well.\\n\\n- **Saying that Signal has users\' identifiable metadata is \\"making shit up\\"**. Is that true? Yes. Signal operates Signal gateways. We know they have at least some MD on (date of user\'s last use).\\n\\nSome may have seen this slide which says that Signal can provide \\"last date of a user\'s connectivity to the service\\". \\n\\n![Signal and user metadata](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata.png)\\n\\n- **Saying that it\'s hypothetically possible is back-pedalling**. It\'s not just \\"hypothetically\\" possible, it\'s simply \\"pending a search warrant\\". It\'s not even Signal that owns Signal gateway nodes - it\'s the freaking AWS!\\n\\nIf law enforcement delivers a search warrant to Signal, Signal gives what they have and law enforcement finds you used Signal yesterday. Then they also find that among 15 suspected friends of yours only one has also used Signal yesterday - how hard is it to guess which of the 15 may be the guy you used Signal to communicate with? \\n\\nIf Signal retains only \\"date\\" (no hour, no second), could AWS be asked to provide their firewall logs to help LE narrow that down a bit? Yes, but only theoretically, so don\'t worry about it!\\n\\nOh, no, they in fact do provide more than just a \\"date\\". Oops! \\n\\n![Signal metadata in response to search warrant](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-response-to-search-warrant.png)\\n\\nMillisecond precision. That\'s [from here](https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/).\\n\\nHow about this scenario:\\n\\n- LE asks Signal for a timestamp and gets it with millisecond precision\\n- LE asks AWS to give list of IPs accessing Signal gateways through AWS firewall during a 200 millisecond interval surrounding the timestamp provided by Signal\\n\\nIs that only theoretical? How many IP addresses would AWS return? 50? How many from a small country? I\'d say just one.\\n\\n- **xx Messenger hasn\'t been touched in a year**. I know that, I know why, and that\'s why in my original message I said that and also gave links for Speakeasy/Haven and the Phoenixx app (at the time called Echoexx and available for alpha testing). But why not ignore all that and make a completely biased and ignorant comment (not that I care, but they purportedly do, being big on education and stuff).\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is vulnerable** (I don\'t have the exact wording). When I mentioned xx Network\'s PQ encryption, they laser-focused on trashing xx Network because of SIDH and completely ignored that I showed that the Signal CEO in fact lied when she said they came up with PQ first, and that SIDH was not vulnerable when xx Messenger adopted it. Now that SIDH has been replaced CTIDH, I wanted to reflect on that thread.\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is a scam**. This is hilarious. xx Messenger wasn\'t a blockchain-based app, it couldn\'t connect to any blockchain whatsoever, and even to this day xx Network\'s cMix is free for use. You don\'t need any coins, I even [blogged about that here](/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important). But there\'s also a subtler, Signal-related point that I want to make at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nSome of their comments are still online:\\n\\n![Warm welcome by ThiccRaiden](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-abuse-01.png)\\n\\nNice people, right? Well, [they say this about themselves](https://www.techlore.tech/about):\\n\\n> We\'re a small team educating people \\n\\nWhen you see \\"don\'t make shit up\\" in response to your civil and on-point comment, you know you\'re being educated!\\n\\nIt\'s a trap!\\n\\n![Warm welcome by Karner](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-abuse-02.png)\\n\\nThis is the owner\'s comment that followed (in which he didn\'t even comment on what I said about the unnecessarily abusive language in several earlier comments):\\n\\n![Warm welcome by Henry Fischer](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-admin-01.png)\\n\\nHis vision (also from the About page):\\n\\n> We envision a world where technology works for us, not against us\u2014and we want to prove to people they can make a real impact for themselves and others\\n\\nThat\'s very funny because I just recalled that, *after* the abuse that followed my comment on xx Network applications as possible alternatives to Wickr, I spent three hours creating (in the appropriate section) a post with xx Network resources, and answering questions from members who were interested in it. Making an impact, contributing, discussing with other knowledge-thirsty individuals, helping your fellow men better themselves - that\'s what it\'s all about, right?\\n\\nAnd where\'s that topic? \\n\\nOh, it\'s nowhere! \\n\\nThey simply deleted my account, responses from the Wickr thread and all the content I\'d created (even from the other generic topic), so it\'s all gone now. They also wiped my xx Network topic from archive.org. \\"We care a lot!\\"\\n\\nSince only the quoted parts of my messages survive and they deleted all my responses while leaving their own comments and attacks online, I think it\'s perfectly appropriate to post about my Techlore experience here where they can\'t censor and delete me.\\n\\n#### Techlore discussion forum tip\\n\\nOnly ever make positive comments about Signal and don\'t double-down on them if you want to last.\\n\\nThat\'s my \\"lesson learned\\" from the short and miserable experience I had on that site.\\n\\nI just checked on archive.org and found that penguin_terminal echoed my thoughts in [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205214557/https://discuss.techlore.tech/t/signal-usernames-are-finally-coming/6069) comment made in 2023:\\n\\n![penguin_terminal on Singal metadata](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-by-penguin_terminal.png)\\n\\nI didn\'t think of this part:\\n\\n> your ISP reports you to the authorizes when logs show you accessing servers used by Signal.\\n\\nOnce your friendly government offices gets the \\"date\\" from Signal, they can ask the local telco or ISP for the hour, time and millisecond. Not that Signal already doesn\'t give that, but getting it locally is easier and they can get your phone number or fixed line subscription details in the same go. Nice!\\n\\nLike me, he got \\"corrected\\" another Signal fan, Tech-Tropper:\\n\\n> This is absolutely theoretical and wrong.\\n\\nEh? Why? Here\'s why Session sucks (according to Tech-Tropper):\\n\\n> Besides, Session does not have PERFECT SECRECY. Just take your recovery code and login in with another device. You will see the messages sent in the last week.\\n\\nIt\'s simple - they \\"just take your recovery code\\". Scientists estimate that 94% of Session users have their recovery code on a yellow Post-it note on the side of their refrigerator.\\n\\nOne last thing about that Wickr thread and techlore.tech I want to say is about that \\"not touching this with a 50ft pole\\" by the site owner. Does this make any sense to you:\\n\\n- The guy kept using Signal without PQ encryption (simply because Signal **did not have any**) for years. He presumably still uses it, despite Signal having his phone number, responds to warrants, while both Signal and AWS have access to his metadata\\n- But xx Messenger is a disaster because SIDH was found to be vulnerable. Never mind that there\'s no evidence that the app was exploited or even exploitable.\\n\\nI don\'t know what\'s wrong with people on that site and I won\'t speculate about it. \\n\\nI\'m just happy that they deleted my account before I wasted too much time there.\\n\\n## xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good\\n\\nI want to elaborate on that scam accusation and the parallels with Signal, as I said I\'d do at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nOn Techlore forums they justify Signal\'s \\"need\\" for phone numbers as the only way to prevent spam. \\n\\nUgh, okay, but that\'s a \\"in order to save the village, we had to destroy it\\" kind of measure for a *privacy*-related application!\\n\\nxx Network is still [completely free and will introduce API limiting only for power users and only when postage becomes available](/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important), you don\'t need a phone number *and* you can use a network-native, decentralized identity. This has worked this way since 2022. Phoenixx also implements ENS-related identity (ENS). \\n\\nxx Network is open to spam, that\'s true. If it was spammed, postage would probably be implemented sooner. But if you don\'t know a person\'s xx Network identity (which you can\'t unless they give it to you), there\'s no way to spam them in the first place so spam is still not a problem. \\n\\nIf you now consider just the privacy aspect here: which of these is a bigger honeypot and potential (privacy) scam here? \\n\\nOne app has your phone number and some metadata. \\n\\nThe other doesn\'t know anything about you, its gateways are decentralized in dozens of jurisdictions, there\'s nowhere to \\"register\\" your data and there\'s no plan for the average user to ever needing to pay anything.\\n\\nI don\'t think either of the platforms is a \\"scam\\", but it\'s easy to see which one is designed for privacy and why having a coin users don\'t ever have to buy beats collecting phone numbers.\\n\\nOne of them is a major honeypot, that\'s for sure.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\n- xx Network client now uses CTIDH\\n- Don\'t believe everything you read on Techlore"},{"id":"2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-17-speakeasy-haven-anonymous-event-chat.md","title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","description":"Simple PoC that shows how xx Network chat can be used in your application or on your Web site","date":"2024-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"apps","permalink":"/blog/tags/apps"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","apps"],"description":"Simple PoC that shows how xx Network chat can be used in your application or on your Web site","keywords":["speakeasy","haven","chat"],"image":"/img/blog/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh"},"nextItem":{"title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not"}},"content":"- [How to include xx Network chat in your application](#how-to-include-xx-network-chat-in-your-application)\\n- [What works and what doesn\'t](#what-works-and-what-doesnt)\\n- [Try it on Codepen](#try-it-on-codepen)\\n- [Take-aways](#take-aways)\\n\\n## How to include xx Network chat in your application\\n\\nThis is a very simple test or \\"proof of concept\\", if you will, for the inclusion of xx Network chat in Web applications.\\n\\nTo minimize the amount of work required, I used `iframe`s:\\n\\n- The top frame shows a Web-based ImpressJS presentation\\n- The bottom frame shows xx Network Haven (formerly Speakeasy) app - event organizer is showing his view of a channel while using the community instance at https://haven.xx.network.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations.png)\\n\\nThe chat participants don\'t login to Haven in this Web browser. \\n\\nThe bottom frame only shows chat from event participants, but both the top and bottom frame are just for viewing of organizer\'s content. \\n\\nAny chat comment would be entered by each chat participant in their own xx Haven session (maybe another browser altogether).\\n\\nCan guests comment and how?\\n\\nThe event organizer *may* share the invitation link and password in order to allow participants to comment from own Haven instance (accessed in the participant\'s browser), but that is optional.\\n\\nWe have several possible scenarios. For example:\\n\\n- Only the event owner can chat (answer voice questions, share links...)\\n- Event owner and event guests (panelists, for example) chat, while guests can only view their comments in that `iframe` above\\n- If event guests are provided with the channel invite, they can login to xx Haven (own or public instance) and chat (ask questions, comment, etc.) as well\\n\\n## What works and what doesn\'t\\n\\nThis is a very basic, no-code PoC, so it\'s not surprising that it\'s not usable in this form. \\n\\nProduction-worthy setup would require some customization of at least xx Haven CSS, if not the application itself.\\n\\nBut even so, we can appreciate and highlight some advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- No email or other identity needs to be shared with the organizer, but panelists or viewers *may* choose to identify themselves by providing a signed proof of external identity\\n- Guests/panelists and possibly viewers receive the link - maybe it\'s shared in the presentation, maybe in another xx Haven channel - but links are not personalized and we can\'t know who is the author of each comment\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- Events open to public comments may be abused by spammers. Although individual accounts can be blocked by channel admin, automated spam attacks would be laborious to deal with so fully open events may be hard to manage\\n- Layout: obviously the xx Haven frame doesn\'t use space economically. We\'d have to create an instance that only exposes the chat itself, and possibly put that \\"chat box\\" in a narrow, vertical frame to the right\\n\\nxx Network currently retains messages for three weeks which may be both good and bad depending on use case.\\n\\n## Try it on Codepen\\n\\nYou can try this on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/).\\n\\nFirst, switch the layout to have the code (HTML, CSS, JS) panes on the right hand side.\\n\\nThen paste this code to HTML pane and wait for the sites to load.\\n\\n```html\\n<html>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n<iframe src=\\"https://impress.js.org/#/bored\\" width=\\"1400\\" height=\\"400\\">\\n  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\\n</iframe>\\n    </div>\\n    <div>\\n  <iframe src=\\"https://haven.xx.network\\" width=\\"1400\\" height=\\"500\\">\\n  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\\n</iframe>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nThis screenshot shows a non-default layout (code on the right) with the iframes loaded/loading.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-17-02-iframe-in-codepen.png)\\n\\nIt may be tricky to login to xx Haven here, but it\'s easy to figure out once you realize you can scroll both left-right and up-down within the bottom frame.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nWhile this \\"integration\\" isn\'t even an integration - it\'s just two `iframe`s - I think it does show the opportunity for using xx Network for events in which the identity of each chat participant can remain hidden and any comments cannot be linked to them even by the event organizer.\\n\\nThis runs contrary to the approach taken by most marketing-focused events - in the sense that participants\' privacy *decreases* engagement and tracking - but for events where privacy of the commenter is important, there\'s no way to link a participant\'s IP address with comments.\\n\\nA participant\'s IP address could be hidden by accessing the Web event address over Tor, but comments may be entered directly in participant\'s own instance of xx Haven which can even be running locally (e.g. in container). \\n\\nFurthermore, xx Haven provides unique, reusable identities (bossCompartmentalisedDisownment in the first screenshot), so each network identity can be reused without disclosing the participant\'s IP address and/or true identity. This may be useful in situations where a participant wishes to be recognized - for example, a designated identity may be reused across events to provide support or engage in 1-on-1 chat with participants for follow up."},{"id":"2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-08-securedrop-vs-speakeasy-haven-and-tor-secretservice.md","title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","description":"SecureDrop tries to reinvent the wheel instead of integrating decentralized messengers","date":"2024-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"tor","permalink":"/blog/tags/tor"}],"readingTime":7.495,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","tor"],"description":"SecureDrop tries to reinvent the wheel instead of integrating decentralized messengers","keywords":["speakeasy","haven","xx network","securedrop"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat"},"nextItem":{"title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view"}},"content":"[I\'ve said it already](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1589835968911413249) so I\'ll just rephrase: it takes three PhDs to use SecureDrop - one admin, one journalist and one user.\\n\\nBut you don\'t know what you don\'t know, so instead of fixing the complicated mess that (current) SecureDrop is - which could be done by including **any** viable open source decentralized messenger into their packaged solution - they\'re coming up with [a new protocol](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol) of their own. Of course.\\n\\nWhat does it do?\\n\\n> What is implemented here is a small-scale, self-contained, anonymous message box, where anonymous parties (sources) can contact and receive replies from trusted parties (journalists). \\n\\nWhere\'s the server?\\n\\n> Server: For this project, a server might be a physical dedicated server housed in a trusted location, a physical server in an untrusted location, or a virtual server in a trusted or untrusted context. Besides the initial setup, all the connections to the server have to happen though the Tor Hidden Service Protocol. \\n\\nFine, I\'ll just set up my own Hidden Service.\\n\\nBut, does Source need a PhD? \\n\\n> Source(s): No on-device persistence shall be required for a source to interact with the system; they should be able to conduct all communications using only a single, theoretically-memorizable passphrase. The source uses Tor Browser to preserve their anonymity.\\n\\nJust using Tor Browser properly is very hard. Haven users don\'t need to use Tor, but they may if they wish. Because with Haven, Tor is optional so it\'s much harder to use Tor incorrectly if either party does choose to use it for secure direct messaging.\\n\\nI\'d even say that modern messaging apps like xx Network\'s Haven almost *cannot* be used incorrectly. Choose a strong password and don\'t have a spyware infested browser or OS. That\'s basically it.\\n\\nBut this is SecureDrop, so here we go again... Start by subscribing to Udemy\'s \\"Python from Zero to Hero\\"...\\n\\n```sh\\n# python3 source.py -h\\nusage: source.py [-h] [-p PASSPHRASE] -a {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete} [-i ID] [-m MESSAGE] [-f FILES [FILES ...]]\\n\\noptions:\\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\\n  -p PASSPHRASE, --passphrase PASSPHRASE\\n                        Source passphrase if returning\\n  -a {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete}, --action {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete}\\n                        Action to perform\\n  -i ID, --id ID        Message id\\n  -m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE\\n                        Plaintext message content for submissions or replies\\n  -f FILES [FILES ...], --files FILES [FILES ...]\\n                        List of local files to submit\\n```\\n\\n## How it could be done\\n\\n### Pull method\\n\\nIn this approach Source shares files over a Tor Hidden Service and informs a Journalist to download the file.\\n\\nThis doesn\'t require *any* development. \\n\\n- Journalist publishes their Haven nick (e.g. MrTriggerHappyJourno) \\n- Source runs owns [Haven container](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container) or accesses other party\'s (e.g. public) Haven instance to create their own identity (DrDeepThroat)\\n- Source initiates chat with Journalist using Haven by contacting them directly and inviting them to personal chat channel with DrDeepThroat and MrTriggerHappyJourno as the only participants\\n- If the Source decides to share their files, they start Onion container with Hidden (Web) Service and share the link to the Journalist in Haven private chat\\n\\nI provide a walk-through and sample configuration files below.\\n\\n### Push method\\n\\nThis approach follows SecureDrop\'s approach where the \\"file upload\\" site is operated by Journalist. That seems like a very risky idea to me - Sources would better off uploading files to one of decentralized S3 services - but that\'s how SecureDrop does it.\\n\\nIn this approach they would still use a decentralized secure messenger (Haven from xx Network or some other) and the same Web server app Secure Drop already has.\\n\\n## Walk-through for Pull method\\n\\nI think it\'s easier to use Haven and Pull method than SecureDrop (Push method) and I\'ll show you why.\\n\\nWith Docker installed, the Source downloads this repository from Tor Browser or over SOCKS5 proxy (using git cli) and starts all the services they\'ll need. \\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container\\ncd xx-haven-container/tor\\ndocker compose up\\n```\\n\\nHaven is now running on localhost (temporary VM) and Caddy provides HTTPS proxy at https://localhost:443 to Source. This takes care of secure messaging and metadata shredding. \\n\\nIf you want to know more, see [this guide](/docs/haven-user-guide/get-started) or fire up your own instance.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-00-xx-network-haven-localhost-service.png)\\n\\nThis list below shows all services in this Docker Compose. \\n\\nThe configuration files can be in line with best practices and thereby require **zero configuration** by either Source (they use Haven and Web server) or Journalist (they use own instance of Haven).\\n\\n- Caddy - HTTPS proxy for Haven\\n- NGINX - Web server that runs my Tor Hidden (Web) Service\\n- Haven - local (personal) instance of Haven (to create Haven identity and chat with Journalist)\\n- Alpine/Tor - Tor server that exposes Hidden (Web) Service at a `.onion` address\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker ps -a\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE\\n52b873713f26   caddy                        \\n324711b42905   nginx:latest  \\n5e3054ec8d21   ghcr.io/armchairancap/haven:latest\\n023a0df1a5ed   alpine:latest \\n```\\n\\nTor is running in Alpine and the Source can get our Hidden Service address from Container ID for `alpine:latest` like so:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker exec -it 023a0df1a5ed cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname\\n6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion\\n# alternatively\\n$ sudo cat tor-service/hostname\\n```\\n\\nThe `hostname` file is in the `tor-service` directory (relative to repo clone location: `./xx-haven-container/tor/tor-service/`).\\n\\nThat\'s all it takes to visit the service on Tor - use Tor Browser to access that link.\\n\\nBut, what is our NGINX service sharing/serving? \\n\\nThe two test files I put in the `tor-docs` subdirectory in the place where I run `docker compose up`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo ls  ./tor-docs/\\nfile.txt  index.html\\n```\\n\\nActually, `index.html` isn\'t even necessary - it\'s there to make this demo simpler - by being able to view index.html which links to file.txt.\\n\\nIn any case, our Source shares 6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion with his Journalist and that\'s it.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-01-hidden-web-service.png)\\n\\nThe Journalist downloads the file over Tor and the Source can see that in Tor logs (in Docker Compose console).\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-02-get-files-from-hidden-web-service.png)\\n\\nAfter the Journalist confirms they got the file in Haven chat channel, the Source uses CTRL+C to stop Docker service and removes everything (the entire ./xx-haven-container/ directory or - even better - the entire temporary VM if they had one). \\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nDon\'t perform this step if you want to reuse your Onion address or Docker Compose example. (Of course, you may, and create another set of Tor and Haven identities next time you use this stack.)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n```sh\\n# press CTRL-C to stop docker-compose\\n# sudo rm -rf ./tor-*\\n```\\n\\nWith Tor identity removed, next time the Sources wishes to use the same stack they have a new Onion address while Haven identity could be restored if they backed it up (by exporting it from Haven Web UI to JSON file) and stored in a secure location.\\n\\nBack to those file names: our Source could share a direct link to the file (6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion/file.txt) and file.txt could be encrypted if you wanted the extra security - the Source may share that password with the Journalist in their private Haven chat channel.\\n\\nThe password could be shared with the Journalist in Haven, but if the file is randomly named there\'s no risk of anyone guessing this file name on a Hidden Service address with directory listing disabled (it is disabled by default on NGINX).\\n\\nTo take that approach, remove index.html and move the content file to a random name:\\n\\n```sh\\n# use CTRL+C to stop docker compose\\n$ openssl rand -hex 50\\ncd7457899fcd7ea28f09b8fd7eec090f9207634501ee910c3a58b3b7bb35e68e8ec17b05a7e1626059a089cd7318ec69589a\\n$ sudo rm ./tor-docs/index.html\\n$ sudo mv ./tor-docs/file.txt ./tor-docs/cd7457899fcd7ea28f09b8fd7eec090f9207634501ee910c3a58b3b7bb35e68e8ec17b05a7e1626059a089cd7318ec69589a\\n$ docker compose start\\n```\\n\\nAll that\'s necessary here is to put your content in ./tor-docs/. There\'s no configuration of any kind. For \\"production\\" purposes a project could further improve configuration files included, of course.\\n \\n- caddy_config/ - auto-configured\\n- caddy_data/ - auto-configured\\n- Caddyfile - 3-line template file for reverse proxy on `localhost`, preconfigured\\n- docker-compose.yml - Docker Compose file, preconfigured\\n- tor-config/ - Tor Hidden Service configuration file (for NGINX), preconfigured\\n- tor-docs/  - file(s) shared over Hidden Service (file.txt, etc.) \\n- tor-service/ - Tor Hidden Service identity file (hostname, pub/priv key) - auto-generated if missing\\n\\nNow, this isn\'t \\"more secure\\" than their latest PoC, but is it worse? \\n\\nIt took me two hours to put it together without writing any code and anyone who uses this is much less likely to make a mistake while using this approach.\\n\\nFind my PoC configuration files [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container/). (Credits: I used [hidden-service-docker](https://github.com/ha1fdan/hidden-service-docker) for Tor and NGINX.)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nSecureDrop wants to reinvent their own wheel despite the fact that there are several good decentralized, secure messengers. \\n\\nNormally, secure drops start with secure messaging and they\'d be better off if they simply picked one of existing options. \\n\\nOnce that\'s taken care of, file upload/download is no longer difficult when done on Onion network. \\n\\nI wouldn\'t say these are \\"solved problems\\", but the point here isn\'t that xx Network\'s Haven \\"solved\\" the problem of secure messaging (maybe it did, maybe it didn\'t - [see for yourself](https://xx.network/whitepapers/)). It is that SecureDrop very likely can\'t solve it *better* than other decentralized messengers.\\n\\nThey ought to stop dreaming about their own \\"protocol\\" and do what they\'re supposed to do which is making it easy to share files in private."},{"id":"2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-11-sec-targets-uniswap-uniban-in-view.md","title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","description":"","date":"2024-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"defi","permalink":"/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":7.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view","title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","defi"],"description":"","keywords":["uniswap","dex","xx network","shapeshift"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not"},"nextItem":{"title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin"}},"content":"- [What does that mean?](#what-does-that-mean)\\n- [Impact on cryptocurrencies](#impact-on-cryptocurrencies)\\n- [What can be done](#what-can-be-done)\\n- [What xx Network has to offer](#what-xx-network-has-to-offer)\\n- [Take-away](#take-away)\\n\\nThe Coin Telegraph [reports](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-token-drops-team-to-fight-sec-wells-notice):\\n\\n> Uniswap Labs founder Hayden Adams said its \u201cready to fight\u201d after disclosing it received a notice of possible enforcement action from the SEC. \\n\\n## What does that mean?\\n\\nLet\'s soak in the wisdom of X for a minute.\\n\\n(Presumed) teenage shitcoiner 1 on X:\\n\\n> No one that uses Uniswap cares about the SEC\\n\\nThe SEC doesn\'t care that no one who uses Uniswap doesn\'t care about the SEC.\\n\\nAll they need to do is to persuade Mr. Adams and fellow developers to pick another hobby (after they beat them in a Biden kangaroo court).\\n\\n(Presumed) teenage shitcoiner 2 on X:\\n\\n> With Dexes like uniswap, SEC can bring down the domain but easily anyone can setup a Dex exchange like Uniswap. \\n\\nLike anyone can setup and run a coin mixer - they can\'t, not for long anyway.\\n\\nThese SEC activities aren\'t unexpected. \\n\\nIt\'s [happened before](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/06/shapeshift-settles-sec-charges-it-sold-crypto-securities/) to ShapeShift which - curiously enough (see the link) - just settled with the SEC some five weeks ago. \\n\\n> The federal regulator instituted a cease-and-desist against ShapeShift, which dissolved its U.S. crypto exchange in 2021.\\n\\nVery encouraging (for the SEC) - it took years, but now it\'s done!\\n\\nOne down, few more to go! Centralized or decentralized doesn\'t matter - as long as there\'s a person that can be sued, they\'re good to go after them. (In the case of the US government they don\'t even care if you\'re a US citizen or resident.)\\n\\nMaybe some used to think - apparently, some on X still do to this day - that one can just ignore the delistings of their coins from CEX or the draconian anti-privacy and anti-liberty laws taking effect in EU and elsewhere. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that\'s not possible as long as we have these quasi-capitalist and socialist governments unite in their fascist and globalist mission to eliminate freedom.\\n\\nIt\'s not hard to imagine what comes next - it\'s not unlike what I said in the post [EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position](/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users). In fact, it\'s the same thing, in my opinion. \\n\\nHere\'s how I see this will play out for DEXes:\\n\\n- Prominent US-based DEX developers, non-profits, community members, server operators are silenced \\n- Many users drop off as well\\n- The same thing happens worldwide\\n- \\"Anonymous\\" (in their opinion) community members continue development and operations (decentralized Git, hidden services on Tor, etc.), but volumes are small and liquidity sucks\\n- Because anonymity and reputation don\'t mix well, scams increase (malicious commits, for example), fundraising becomes hard, and their user base a tiny fraction of what it used to be\\n\\nDecentralized Exchanges won\'t disappear, but they\'re in for a very difficult period. \\n\\nAnother possibility - not immediate, but 3-5 years from now - is that the West sets up some version of the commie firewall that detects and blocks IP addresses of known DEX nodes. I *know* that\'s very difficult to do well, but so is today\'s blocking of general Internet in certain hellholes around world which does work very well. All it takes is a bit of disruption and a globally disruptive legal action which all major governments and globalist organizations seem to be eager to team up on.\\n\\n## Impact on cryptocurrencies\\n\\nIt\'s easy to think this could mainly impact \\"illegal\\" (privacy) coins. That was my first thought, at least.\\n\\nBut that is not the case. It will impact *all DEX users*, *all DEX exchanges* and therefore *all coins*. \\n\\nIn the case of major crypto-currencies, any coin that other coins are denominated in - primarily stablecoins, but also BTC, ETH and others.\\n\\nWho knows, maybe - in I\'m right - privacy coins could regain some of the lost popularity among the leftover DeFi hardliners, but if you lose 90% of users and gain 20%, that\'s still not a great result and you\'re not growing or \\"changing the world\\" (sorry, that\'s as naive as I am willing to go - I won\'t say \\"democratizing finance\\").\\n\\nI\'ve just looked at the past 12 months of Ethereum vs. Monero on Google Trends. I assume the Google globalists aren\'t feeding us fake trends, although we can\'t exclude that possibility.\\n\\nIf you remove Ethereum from the chart and look at Monero alone, you\'ll see it went up a lot in late 2023 and then dropped off. I think it will drop even further (see that post on EU above). \\n\\n![Google Trends - Ethereum vs Monero](/img/blog/2024-04-11-interest-over-time-ethereum-vs-monero-1y.png)\\n\\nBut when Ethereum is added to the chart, Monero looks flat and barely registers.\\n\\nIt\'s not an apples-to-apples comparison, I know, but it shows two things:\\n\\n- The average user cares about flipping coins, not about privacy (not something I like to see, but let\'s admit it)\\n- Despite the ongoing attack on privacy (and other) crypto-currencies in the EU, Monero is attracting just a small fraction of crypto-currency users, which I think confirms my expectation that most crypto-exchange users will give up or trade \\"legal and regulated coins\\" (completely useless circle-jerk as far as I\'m concerned - it\'s no different from flipping FANGs all day long)\\n\\n## What can be done\\n\\nMaybe some \\"benevolent dictator\\" like that Bukele guy (not benevolent in my opinion, but I\'m trying to think like the average teenage Bitcoin fan on X) permits DEX in their country and some prominent developers give up citizenship and relocate there, but this can\'t do anything for the users in countries where the use of decentralized exchanges is illegal.\\n\\nWould economic and political gains from such policies be net-positive? Probably not. Maybe that\'d earn sanctions, cut them off from the IMF/WB, etc. I\'m not suggesting utilitarianism, but merely the fact that politicians have to consider it as there would be a price to pay.\\n\\nAssuming some jurisdictions decide to harbor such activities, the next problem to consider is DEX users\' privacy.\\n\\nI wouldn\'t even attempt to suggest xx Network mixnet (cMixx) could be used to circumvent the problem. This solution already exists and works (see [Proxxy](https://github.com/xx-labs/proxxy/)) and we\'ll probably see it as an extension or \\"Web 3 app\\" in browsers like [Carbon](https://carbon.website/) one day.\\n\\nHow many users will dare to violate laws this way? I\'d say a small minority - primarily those from countries with governments \\"who haven\'t gotten their shit together\\" (yet).\\n\\nTor Browser may be another option, although it\'s not as good a solution as cMixx. It\'s harder to use correctly, and setting up malicious Tor nodes costs next to nothing. In fact it does cost nothing if you\'re a government and fund that activity with freshly printed money or new public debt.\\n\\n## What xx Network has to offer\\n\\nxx Network\'s Proxxy approach acts as a mixing proxy gateway between your client (for example, Carbon browser) and the server (for example, DEX server nodes). This is useful because it breaks the link between DEX activity (observable by all) and user\'s IP and location.\\n\\nIt also hides the connection between a wallet (addresses) and the owner. For non-private coins, a DEX observer would see there\'s a wallet with 123 XYZ coins, and monitor ins and outs, but they couldn\'t see who owns it. If one were to trade on a DEX via Proxxy, they could do that in privacy and exit to a privacy coin (so that the last leg is also anonymized on-chain).\\n\\nBut let\'s not forget that a DEX could route all its messages over xx Network\'s cMix protocol. [xx Network dashboard](https://dashboard.xx.network/) currently shows 3000 messages per second. That could be enough for a DEX that doesn\'t attempt to provide near real-time settlement.\\n\\n![xx Network cMixx Dashboard](/img/blog/2024-04-11-xx-cmix-networ-dashboard.png)\\n\\n3000 messages per second is plenty, and can scale as soon as more nodes are added to the network (which is a function of network economics, but ultimately driven by demand which is currently a community decision and later may become a function of postage fees - more users, more nodes chasing their share of xx Network cMixx postage).\\n\\n## Take-away\\n\\nI\'m not optimistic about this development now and the prospects for crypto-currencies in coming years.\\n\\nBitcoin is already a joke (see the recent news on how almost 50% of mined coins are routed to a single address - presumably almost 50% of \\"virgin coins\\" are bought by Wall Street custodians) and Ethereum isn\'t far behind (just wait until the first ETFs appear - it\'s going to be worse, because of staking which lets Wall Street farm virgin coins directly).\\n\\nCrypto-enthusiasts think they (or \\"someone\\") can ignore what governments do \\"because decentralized\\". That works only until they knock on your door.\\n\\nxx Network (Proxxy, etc.) can help and will help to some extent, but in a NWO environment it still can be stopped.\\n\\nThe only way this can be solved in the long term is by fighting centralization and that means civic engagement against globalists, dictators and autocrats - from the UN over governments of large political unions down to small countries. \\n\\nCode is law, but not the law."},{"id":"2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-06-i-like-wrapped-xx-coin.md","title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","description":"What I like about WXX and what I look forward to","date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"cryptocurrency","permalink":"/blog/tags/cryptocurrency"},{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"defi","permalink":"/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":9.16,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["cryptocurrency","xx network","defi"],"description":"What I like about WXX and what I look forward to","keywords":["evm","wxx","xx coin","erc20","snowbridge","hypernova","substrate","dex","polkadot","cex","supra"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view"},"nextItem":{"title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users"}},"content":"- [Why it\'s good](#why-its-good)\\n- [Why it\'s important](#why-its-important)\\n- [What\'s not so good](#whats-not-so-good)\\n- [Scavengers welcome](#scavengers-welcome)\\n- [More to come](#more-to-come)\\n- [Wrap-up](#wrap-up)\\n\\n\\nPatCrypt created a great [post](https://patcrypt.com/wxx-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wrapped-xx-coin/) about the Wrapped XX coin aka WXX with the contract address `0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2` (view it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2)).\\n\\n## Why it\'s good\\n\\nThe main benefits are already called out by Pat:\\n\\n> - Compatibility with the major Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs)\\n> - A shorter route to being listed by Centralised Exchanges (CEXs)\\n\\nThere\'s a lot to like about that, obviously, especially since:\\n\\n- At least one CEX recently rejected xx coin because \\"it\'s a privacy coin\\" (except that it\'s not - I wrote about that [here](/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users/))\\n- The globalists have been making progress with their plan to \\"allow but disable\\" private cryptocurrencies\\n- Because of the KYC/AML regulations, listing a coin on a CEX has been expensive for years and now it\'s even worse - it\'s more expensive and more scrutinized\\n\\nBecause of that and because xx coin is not a pump-and-dump/meme coin (although anything that\'s tradeable has people who pump it, and xx coin is no exception), xx coin used to have a hard time getting listed. It\'s been listed on [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com) for some time, but that was about it.\\n\\nI know some vocal MEXC users complain about MEXC (not in the context of xx coin, but in general), but considering it\'s located in a low-hassle country, I think it\'s a great exchange and all things considered, less likely to rat on its users than 90% of other CEX (all the EU-based CEX will have to rat on their users once they codify the latest EU regulations.)\\n\\nIn any case, WXX fixes \\"all of the above\\" (challenges): people will be able to get xx coin on centralized and decentralized markets (and anything in between - more on that later).\\n\\nOf course, just being available on one popular DEX would be enough, but on-chain DEX are not known for great liquidity and they\'re (in my opinion anyway) less user-friendly and less liquid, although this last bit may change as more trading moves to DEX due to the fascist laws passed in communist and capitalist jurisdictions alike. We still want and need CEX exchanges, especially in crypto-friendly jurisdictions (go MEXC!).\\n\\n## Why it\'s important \\n\\nI haven\'t traded xx coin, or any coin for that matter, for many years. I haven\'t (yet) sold any xx coins either. When I have enough for my needs (which I now do), I prefer to do things that interest me - if I have free time I\'d rather [do something interesting and hopefully useful to the community](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container) than trade.\\n\\nWhy do I care, then?\\n\\nBecause WXX is good for things I care about, such as privacy and decentralization. \\n\\nIt is very important that xx coin be easy to trade because - see the post on new EU legislation linked above - xx Network plans to introduce postage (fees for prioritized and/or high volume users of its mixing network layer). \\n\\nIf you can\'t buy xx coin, you can\'t pay for postage (once the feature becomes available). That doesn\'t mean you wouldn\'t be able to use xx Network - its mixnet is now completely free to use and I have no reason to think it won\'t retain a generous free tier even when/if postage kicks in.\\n\\nBut I want xx Network to attract large users who pay postage, because that creates a virtuous circle: demand for xx coin to pay for mixnet postage creates a demand for coins earned (and sold) by mixnet runners (\\"validators\\"), which makes xx Network sustainable for both paid and free users. \\n\\nThis may seem trivial now (hey, it\'s free and it\'s working just fine as-is!), but remember this next time you use Signal and get that donation prompt upon starting the app.\\n\\n## What\'s not so good\\n\\nThere isn\'t much not to like. \\n\\nPatCrypt\'s posts mentions some admin to-do\'s and the fact that WXX is currently semi-centralized (which is what I mentioned \\"something in between\\" a CEX and DEX - even when traded on a DEX, it\'s still semi-centralized until EVM bridge comes about, which should be shortly).\\n\\nA wrapped xx Coin was recently listed on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) where liquidity is thin and it appears there aren\'t many users. One may be reasonably skeptical about WXX as well, but I am optimistic because ERC20 tokens are everywhere. Anyone who owns more than two coins probably has an ERC20-compatible wallet or a CEX account and can easily access any DEX by simply installing an app. XRPL is accessible as well, but I feel its main user base are Ripple-focused users, which is fine but not as large as these new markets.\\n\\n## Scavengers welcome\\n\\nI won\'t put this under good or bad, it\'s something that simply is, and can\'t be judged.\\n\\nAn immediate effect of WXX is that its existence increases opportunities for trading, because the more markets which also means more opportunities for arbitrage. \\n\\nWith xx coin available on MEXC, XRPL, WXX (including DEX-es, each of which may be \\"out of sync\\" with others) and the fact that only MEXC has its own API while integrations for others already exist (for different ERC20 tokens, but it just takes a search-and-replace), it\'s no longer prohibitively expensive to build a bot that trades xx coins among several markets. It takes just one MEXC integration and a xx-focused repurposing of ERC20-compatible code for other markets.\\n\\nIt\'s kind of silly, but necessary. Scavengers exist because they need to exist. The main benefit for the regular buyer (or seller) is they get close to best price and liquidity regardless of where they buy (or sell) their coin. \\n\\nRemember that, initially at least - until an Ethereum bridge is built and WXX decentralized - it may be inconvenient to easily move coins between MEXC, XRPL wrapped coin and WXX coin, but this will get easy for WXX once those to-do\'s are completed. For people who engage in arbitrage and move a lot of coins around this means arbitrage will remain inconvenient until that EVM bridge becomes available.\\n\\n## More to come\\n\\nThree things I\'d like to mention here:\\n\\nFirstly, Pat\'s article does mention [Snowbridge](https://docs.snowbridge.network/), a trustless Polkadot bridge technology which - once completed - will bridge Substrate (Polkadot, initially) and Ethereum - something I\'ve been looking forward to since last year.\\n \\nSnowbridge is now getting attention in the xx community, but I think there still isn\'t enough appreciation for what had to happen in order to get here: the fact that xx Network picked a Substrate-based chain, which is the only reason why Snowbridge is now relevant to xx Network in the first place.\\n\\nThey could have picked some cooler \\"next gen\\" blockchain design with even faster finality and whatnot, but they decided to build on Substrate where all chains and parachains benefit from network effect.\\n\\nPerhaps this isn\'t the best comparison, but Substrate can be compared to the Linux kernel. Once an improvement is implemented - due to permissive licensing - it becomes a new feature that every Linux application can use - all Substrate-based blockchains (\\"Linux applications\\") can easily benefit from it. That\'s why it will be relatively easy for xx chain to benefit from Snowbridge without spending many months on developing novel code just for your own project.\\n\\n(This reminds me - even the development effort for a xx Network EVM bridge (that xx Foundation has awarded a grant for) probably significantly benefits from the ability to reference 3rd party EVM bridge implementations for Substrate chains. That\'s why that doesn\'t take quarters, but only months.)\\n\\nSo again, kudos to David Chaum and the team for making a good choice here. Maybe it wasn\'t a hard choice - naturally a decentralized mixnet project would pick a well-maintained and popular chain with governance features built-in, rather than a niche or new chain that requires a lot of in-house chain development - but it was still a choice and they chose wisely.\\n\\nSecondly, due to network effects of the Substrate chain ecosystem, I think it won\'t take long for Polkadot to take advantage of Supra\'s [HyperNova](https://supra.com/news/HyperNova-Consensus/). Punchline:\\n\\n> In short, Supra verifies Ethereum\u2019s L1 consensus cryptographically. \\n\\nIn other words (please visit that link to find out more), Supra\'s HyperNova *does not* need staked bridges that create multi-signature transactions. \\n\\nThe quoted part mentions Ethereum, obviously because that is likely to be the first target for Supra, but the same design applies to other L1 chains. \\n\\nHyperNova is a new design and quarters may pass before it becomes available. But once it does, if Polkadot gets integrated, it becomes easy for xx Chain to get integrated as well. That means a Supra-wrapped xx coin could become instantly available on Supra in a decentralized, management-free and derisked (considering it\'s bridgeless) manner. \\n\\nThirdly, the benefits of Substrate flow in both directions. It is easy for other Substrate projects to connect with xx chain (not just for trading, but for on-chain identity, native assets held, balances, voting history, and other information xx chain holds). You can take a look at the Crust Network (based on a Substrate chain) documentation to see how they have a separate section for integration with Substrate-based chains, for example.\\n\\nThey recently released Ethereum integrations, but even in that case, it\'s nice to have a choice and be able to easily integrate semi-natively using the familiar Polkadot SDK. Ethereum bridges have many advantages (see WXX), but also adds a bit of complexity, risk, round-trip-time and cost. It\'s not the only answer. \\n\\nxx Wallet was able to showcase native Crust Network integration by making their application code to load in one\'s xx wallet. I haven\'t looked if there are multi-coin wallets for Substrate and how they work, but they could make it easy to do buy xx coin for postage and use the purchased \\"message tokens\\" to pay for (xx) mixnet (proxied API) traffic created by Web 3 apps that work on other Substrate chains. It may take a year or two, but it\'s doable.\\n\\nThese are just three examples - there must be more - where Substrate (Polkadot SDK) can take care of 80% of the plumbing. It is much appreciated, but still widely underappreciated!\\n\\n## Wrap-up\\n\\nWXX makes xx coin available to all ERC20-capable wallets and markets. \\n\\nThis is a product of hard and smart work by xx Network developers (including the wise choice to use Polkadot SDK) and the wider Substrate and crypto community.\\n\\nAlso because of Substrate, the best is yet to come. \\n\\n- an integration with Snowbridge could give xx coin a *native and trustless* xx-chain-to-Ethereum bridging \\n- Supra HyperNova - this would also require an xx chain-specific, but not unique, integration and would enable a direct, trustless *and bridgeless* xx-to-Supra cross-chain interoperability. I plan to keep an eye on HyperNova, especially if Substrate or Polkadot are mentioned\\n- DEX for native Substrate coins - useful for multi-currency Substrate wallets and shapeshift-like purchases of xx mixnet credits (to pay for postage)"},{"id":"2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-23-eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users.md","title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","description":"Anti-privacy legislation puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"cryptocurrency","permalink":"/blog/tags/cryptocurrency"}],"readingTime":4.275,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["cryptocurrency"],"description":"Anti-privacy legislation puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","keywords":["law","privacy","anonymous","monero","xx coin","eu","aml","AML Package","AMLD6"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to use xx Network CLI","permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client"}},"content":"## Draconian anti-privacy regulations \\n\\ncryptotimes.io [reports](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/03/23/eus-new-aml-laws/) on the new anti-money laundering (AML) legislation in the EU:\\n\\n> The new regulations place restrictions on the use of cash. Any cash payment exceeding \u20ac10,000 will be restricted, and any anonymous cash transaction over \u20ac3,000 will be forbidden. Payments with cryptocurrency made with anonymous wallets are prohibited as well. \\n\\nFrom a [page linked from the article](https://www.dilloneustace.com/legal-updates/status-update-on-the-eu-aml-package):\\n\\n> a Regulation on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing (the \u201cEU Single Rulebook\u201d) and the sixth (6th) Anti-Money Laundering Directive (\u201cAMLD6\u201d).\\n\\nPrivacy and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are rightfully outraged.\\n\\nOne point the latter - especially EU-based Monero supporters active on social media such as X - are still missing is that the regulations, once formalized in \\"laws\\" will make their advocacy untenable.\\n\\nOf course that I feel bad for them and other non-criminal users affected by these changes even though I don\'t hold any privacy coins including Monero.\\n\\nThat aside, they are still missing the fact that the regulations put them in an untenable position.\\n\\n## Untenable position\\n\\nIf you\'re an *active* Monero user who uses MNR, you now must report transaction details to the government. \\n\\nIf you do that, what kind of privacy coin is that? It\'s arguably no different from custodial USDT or fiat checking accounts!\\n\\nPromoting Monero while dutifully reporting all transactions and identifying parties in incoming or outgoing transactions would be terribly wrong.\\n\\nBut, since you\'re active on traditional social media, that makes you a high profile target for \\"routine\\" checks and possibly heavy fines. Because of that *not reporting* your transactions becomes very risky for anyone active on centralized social media. \\n\\nThat is what makes the situation of Monero users active in social media untenable. Their choices are becoming very limited.\\n\\nEU residents who continue Monero advocacy on centralized social media have two choices:\\n\\n- inform the government about their Monero transactions\\n- not use Monero at all\\n\\nThose who continue using Monero and do not plan reporting their transactions will be at risk and likely disappear from centralized social media to lower their risk profile.\\n\\nOne group that won\'t be at risk is Monero speculators and traders, but we don\'t need to consider this group as the number of centralized exchanges with Monero pairs in the EU is very limited (and declining) and at the same time using a decentralized exchange for trading and speculation automatically makes one a person who uses anonymous crypto transactions and likely well over the limit.\\n\\nCriminals are the group that will be least affected, that much is sure. \\n\\n## xx coin is unaffected\\n\\nDavid Chaum\'s idea to not make xx coin a privacy coin was very smart. \\n\\nI must admit initially I wanted more privacy features for xx coin, but in hindsight the man knew what he was doing!\\n\\nxx Network and xx chain protect privacy of messages which helps crypto and Web3 users make their transactions and applications much more private, but the coin that runs xx chain is not a privacy coin.\\n\\nThis lower exposure to legislative risks makes it easier for the xx Network community to grow and the coin doesn\'t even need to be widely used for payments.\\n\\n**Staking** - available today - allow nominators to get a return on staked coins.\\n\\nThe first, still missing piece, is work-in-progress: **xx coin on decentralized exchanges**. Today wrapped xx coin is available on [XRPL](https://xrpl.org/), but there is work in progress on EVM bridge which will make it possible to trade xx coin on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nEventually xx coin will be used to pay **postage (xxPostage) for premium traffic on xx Network**, which will create demand for it. By then it should be easy to buy it on decentralized cryptocurrency  exchanges.\\n\\nxx coin is not used in mainstream P2P crypto payments and speculation (which is easy to check by looking at turnover). So far its main use case is staking.\\n\\nBecause no coin ownership or transactions are required for participation, EU-based fans of xx Network promote privacy and use the cMix services without holding a single xx coin!\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nMost EU-based promoters of the top privacy coins will gradually cease using their coins in ways that protect privacy. What will they promote then?\\n\\nSome will hodl and drop out, while few others may pump and dump their cons for as long as those coins are listed on a centralized exchange.\\n\\nThose who remain active on centralized social media are very likely *not* going to be the user of the very coin they promote. \\n\\nI therefore expect a significant drop in social media presence of *real* EU-based users of privacy coins. \\n\\nDr. Chaum picked a different way to fight the good fight and latest changes in the EU regulations related to AML do not affect xx Network any more than they affect the regular privacy-less coin. Not to mention that all of us can use the main thing we advocate - xx Network - without any transactions on the xx blockchain. For most users that means no transactions, no reporting and no regulations to worry about."},{"id":"2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-09-xx-network-cli-irc-like-client.md","title":"How to use xx Network CLI","description":"How to get started with xx Network CLI client","date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":5.92,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","title":"How to use xx Network CLI","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"How to get started with xx Network CLI client","keywords":["xx network","chat","broadcast","cli","text","client","irc"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users"},"nextItem":{"title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt"}},"content":"## Introduction \\n\\nxx Network is a privacy-focused, quantum-resistant \\"small messaging\\" network.\\n\\nBy \\"small messaging\\" I mean up to KB-sized messages, although it\'s possible to use larger messages as well. For example, xx Messenger supports small attachments (tens of KB).\\n\\nxx CLI client is a reference client implementation for xx Network that at this time uses the older \\"broadcast module layer\\" approach. \\n\\nSpeakeasy (Haven) or Echoexx use a better approach (channels), but all of them use the xx Network SDK (xxDK). \\n\\nxx CLI client repository has a read-me file that contains almost all the steps required to get started, but this post can still save you some time.\\n\\n## Build\\n\\nAt this time we need `go1.21`, but check the source to verify if this requirement changed.\\n\\nThese steps are for Linux. Check the repository\'s read-me file for other OS.\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://git.xx.network/elixxir/cli-client && cd cli-client/\\ngo mod vendor && go mod tidy\\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags \'-w -s\' -o xx-client main.go\\n```\\n:::info\\nOn ARM64 devices, use `GOARCH=arm64` or omit `GOARCH` (it should be detected automatically).\\n:::\\n\\n## Use xx CLI\\n\\nLet\'s see how to use xx CLI client.\\n\\n### First user\\n\\nSomeone needs to create a broadcast (chat) first.\\n\\nWe can do that with `--new`, and give your broadcast a name and a description. \\n\\nSetup procedure creates 2 files you need to know about: \\n\\n- the first one is the broadcast definition file by default named $CHANNEL.xxchan (here, `test.xxchan`)\\n- the second is a private RSA key for the creator who is also channel admin. This one is by default named `$CHANNEL-privateKey.pem` (here, `test-privateKey.pem`).\\n\\n```sh\\nexport NICK=\\"my-Name\\"\\n./xx-client broadcast --new -o test.xxchan -n \\"test\\" -d \\"Some desc\\"\\n./xx-client broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n./xx-client.linux64 broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n# in case of timeouts try logLevel 1 or 2 with: --logLevel 1\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\n`test.xxchan` is the broadcast definition file which enables another party to listen to this broadcast. Secure it if your broadcast is private.\\n:::\\n\\nThe default wait timeout value wasn\'t enough, so I extended it with `--waitTimeout`. \\n\\nThe reason is lately some xx Network gateway nodes had difficulties (potentially due to government interference in some countries) which makes it harder to connect. There\'s a log file which you can tail from another terminal to see that.\\n\\nIf you want to use a self-supplied RSA key, use `--key ${FILENAME}` to specify the RSA private key file, such as `--key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_xxcli`.\\n\\n### Second user\\n\\nThe second user needs the broadcast definition file, as there\'s no way to establish chat without it. \\n\\n:::warning\\nShare the broadcast file through Signal or use some other secure sharing method. A chat is no more secure than the medium through which this file has been shared.\\n:::\\n\\nThe second user would normally have another nickname (although they\'re really identified by their private key) and needs to only load the channel, not create it. \\n\\nHere we\'ll create the RSA key manually before we start (as we don\'t need to create a channel). This also means you can reuse existing RSA key if you have it.\\n\\n```sh\\nexport NICK=\\"AnotherGuy\\"\\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f AnotherGuyKeyfile\\n# move your new private key to the default private key file name for the chat \\"test\\"\\nmv AnotherGuyKeyfile test-privateKey.pem\\n# test.xxchan is the configuration file obtained from the first party\\n./xx-client.linux64 broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nFor each client we use a different terminal (or different client altogether). Different chats use different broadcast definition files.\\n:::\\n\\nAnd that is it!\\n\\n![xx Network CLI](/img/xx-network-cli-01.png)\\n\\nThere are minor console-related bugs, and you\'ll need to reconnect (simply CTRL+C and then restart) if you get disconnected. \\n\\n## Other details\\n\\nThere are other details that you can find from online help, or by inspecting the code.\\n\\n```raw\\nAvailable Commands:\\n  broadcast   Create or join broadcast channels.\\n  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell\\n  generate    Generates version and dependency information for the binary.\\n  help        Help about any command\\n  version     Print the version and dependency information for the binary.\\n\\nFlags:\\n  -c, --config string          Path to YAML file with custom configuration..\\n  -h, --help                   help for cli-client\\n  -v, --logLevel int           Verbosity level for log printing (2+ = Trace, 1 = Debug, 0 = Info).\\n  -l, --logPath string         File path to save log file to.

(default \\"session\\")\\n      --waitTimeout duration   Duration to wait for messages to arrive. (default 15s)\\n```\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\nxx CLI client cannot communicate with Speakeasy or Echoexx - as noted earlier, these use different module of xxDK.\\n\\nBut it can be useful on its own. Some examples:\\n\\n- secure & private DM or group chat client for headless and remote systems without X Window System - like IRC, but with fewer features and more secure and private\\n- share IT-related secrets such as passwords and .env files with yourself or colleagues: load channel file, start the client, send or receive secrets and then delete the entire directory on the temporary client \\n\\nA bit more on this last use case. You should use encrypted boot volume or change the secret if it\'s critical, as it\'s not technically possible to shred/wipe a single file on an unencrypted flash disk. For this use case you need to be able to get out to the Internet which is often, but not always (e.g. LAN) possible.\\n\\nThere are CLI scripts for \\"secure\\" password sharing, but they rely on personal infrastructure (some server & DB which may or may not be secure), or 3rd party infrastructure which may or may not be more secure than xx Network (and often doesn\'t have open source code on both the server and client).\\n\\nThere\'s also Tailscale, but again - to be equally secure, you still have to encrypt your data before sending it and probably at-rest as well (considering that the client is \\"online\\" at all times). If you can make use of Tailscale for other things that\'s great, but if you need something quick - like when setting up some VMs in the cloud - xx CLI client could be good enough.\\n\\nxx CLI client could also be modified for other purposes, for example as a low censorship-free broadcast tool without the need for Tor (which mony networks block in any case). Access to the xx Network gateways can also be blocked, but most jurisdictions and corporate firewalls haven\'t done it yet.\\n\\nAs of now, xx Network gateways retain client side-encrypted data for 21 days, after which it expires and may be found only on the clients (if they logged in and downloaded it before it expired). So, keep in mind that you may shred the local session file, channel file and private key to disable access locally, while chat data stored on xx Network gateways expires in weeks. What you cannot delete is the messages other clients received on their side without access to those clients."},{"id":"2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-05-security-text-file.md","title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","description":"Case for xx Network Haven chat link in security.txt","date":"2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"haven","permalink":"/blog/tags/haven"}],"readingTime":2.58,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","haven"],"description":"Case for xx Network Haven chat link in security.txt","keywords":["xx network","haven","security.txt","chat","contact"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to use xx Network CLI","permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","permalink":"/blog/2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify"}},"content":"## security.txt\\n\\nThe Dutch Digital Trust Center mandates that all government sites must have a security files under the `.well-known` directory located at the root of Web site.\\n\\nUse cases:\\n\\n- Go-to place to get information on how to report vulnerabilities affecting the site or organization\\n- Improve the speed of getting in touch\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nhttps://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt captured on Jun 1, 2023.\\n\\n```raw\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\nHash: SHA512\\n\\n# Domeinen van de Rijksoverheid kunnen met een 302 redirect verwijzen naar\\n# het centrale bestand op https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt\\n# omdat het NCSC het centrale meldpunt is voor kwetsbaarheden en incidenten\\n# voor de Rijksoverheid.\\n#\\n# Dutch central government domains can redirect to the central file located\\n# at https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt with a 302 redirect,\\n# because NCSC-NL is the central point of contact for vulnerabilities and\\n# incidents for the Dutch central government.\\n\\nExpires: 2024-01-31T22:59:00.000Z\\nCanonical: https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt\\n\\nPolicy: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden\\nPolicy: https://english.ncsc.nl/contact/reporting-a-vulnerability-cvd\\n\\nContact: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden\\nContact: https://english.ncsc.nl/contact/reporting-a-vulnerability-cvd\\nContact: mailto:security@ncsc.nl\\nEncryption: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/pgp-key\\nPreferred-Languages: nl, en\\n\\nAcknowledgments: https://www.ncsc.nl/wall-of-fame\\nHiring: https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: Encryption Desktop 10.4.2 (Build 1298)\\nCharset: utf-8\\n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\\nlNVMWzOncidAWM0nXcuYTjZagRAagthF\\n=yC4A\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n```\\n\\n## Use case for Haven\\n\\n- security.txt is PGP-signed to confirm that it was signed by the key owner and that\'s fine. But in reality most people hate to use it to compose emails or messages\\n- it is time-consuming for the recipient to download every sender\'s key which also delays reading encrypted messages\\n- Haven gives the reporter anonymity, both parties enjoy encryption and privacy, and can interact in real time (and still move to email if they so choose)\\n- Haven uses quantum-resistant encryption (I haven\'t checked, but it should be superior to PGP)\\n\\nHaven public chat link can be added to security.txt. Example: \\n\\n```raw\\nChat: https://.............. (security vulnerabilities only)\\nContact: email - mailto:.........; chat - send DM to `aCertainTestifier`\\nEncryption: https://www..../contact/pgp-key\\n```\\n\\nBecause public chat could have several permanently present strangers in it, direct messages (DM) should be sent to contact person.\\n\\nWhat are the weaknesses of using Haven here? \\n\\nThe way I see it, the biggest is that xx Network keeps messages for 21 days and then they disappear. To prevent the situation where nothing happens for three weeks and messages disappear, the reporting person should move on to email if no response is received within hours.\\n\\nWith time, spam may become a problem for Haven. But it is already a problem for email now, so Haven is not worse.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nHaven uses xx Network to store encrypted messages and Haven users can connect to xx Network from any (trusted) application server - whether it\'s container on own desktop client, the official Haven instance, etc. \\n\\nCompared to an email or Web service as means of communication, Haven is less likely to be affected by a vulnerability at the same time as your corporate email or Web service, so it is a cost-free, \\"out-of-band\\" solution that\'s more resistant to unplanned concurrent downtime or DDoS.\\n\\nHaven gives you zero maintenance, quantum-resistant encryption, superior privacy (compared to email and PGP), and far more convenience."},{"id":"2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-08-xx-network-wallet-sign-verify/index.md","title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","description":"Use the official xx Network Web wallet to sign and verify messages","date":"2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"sign","permalink":"/blog/tags/sign"},{"label":"verify","permalink":"/blog/tags/verify"},{"label":"wallet","permalink":"/blog/tags/wallet"}],"readingTime":1.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","sign","verify","wallet"],"description":"Use the official xx Network Web wallet to sign and verify messages","keywords":["xx network","cryptographically","sign","message","validate","signature"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt"},"nextItem":{"title":"Install xx Network Haven","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/30/install-xx-network-haven"}},"content":"## Sign\\n\\nGo to `Developer` > `Sign and Verify` > `Sign message`\\n\\nPick an address (\\"wallet\\") to use and enter a message or other data you wish to sign with your wallet key to `sign the following data`. \\n\\nThis may be any text such as your Speakeasy codename, email address, etc.\\n\\n![Sign message from xx Network wallet](xx-network-wallet-sign.png)\\n\\nClick on the copy icon to copy the signature (`signature of supplied data`) to clipboard. \\n\\n## Verify\\n\\nTo verify, go to `Verify signature` rather than `Sign and Verify`.\\n\\n`Verify using address` means the signer\'s wallet address (so, usually not your own).\\n\\nYou need to provide the same wallet and message that you got, and if everything checks out, the icon next to `the supplied signature` will become a green check mark.\\n\\nBad signatures will fail to verify.\\n\\n![Bad signature fails to verify](xx-network-wallet-verify-bad-hash.png)\\n\\nBad data will also fail to verify against a correct signature.\\n\\n![Correct signature and content verify](xx-network-wallet-verify-incomplete.png)\\n\\nTo be successful, verification requires the same wallet, message data and signature that were used to generate the signature.\\n\\n![Correct verification](xx-network-wallet-verify.png)\\n\\n## Non-deterministic signatures\\n\\nxx Network uses Schnorrkel (sr25519) which doesn\'t create deterministic signatures.\\n\\nFor example, I created two additional signatures.

If you have Docker or Postman and want to run Haven in a container, try [this](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container).\\n\\nIn the case you want to self-host a non-containerized Haven, read on!\\n\\n## Home or cloud\\n\\nYou may install Speakeasy at home or in the cloud.\\n\\nHaven Web server doesn\'t hold any data but its OS and Node.js logs may store client IPs, that\'s all. \\n\\nWith that in mind, some high-level considerations would be:\\n\\n- We don\'t want our Speakeasy Web app or underlying OS to get compromised\\n- If your Haven is not open to public, or is accessed \\"by invite\\" (maybe with basic authentication or VPN, for your family and friends), you may run it at home\\n- If your Haven is located in the cloud, that\'s acceptable as long as you can protect it from getting compromised so that application code doesn\'t get replaced, OS compromised, or visitors\' IPs leaked.\\n\\nRegarding this last point, if you feel comfortable hosting your Haven server in a small (1G RAM) VM, it is better to open it to public to have the Web server accessed by a variety of addresses. As long as you know how to protect the VM.\\n\\n:::tip\\nEach participant in a conversation can use a different Speakeasy Web server, so many deployment combinations are possible.\\n:::\\n\\n## Software and hardware requirements\\n\\nUse a Linux OS or VM, x86_64 or ARM64 architecture. Haven\'s hardware requirements are minimal:\\n\\n- 1 vCPU\\n- 1 GB RAM\\n- 3 GB disk\\n\\nAll Haven app/web server does is serve the app to the client(s) and that\'s one-time download from each client (around 100 MB download).\\n\\nOne vCPU is enough and won\'t be significantly utilized except when Node.js builds the application or when container image is updated - that takes a long time (15 minutes), but has to be done only when Haven code is updated or rebuilt.\\n\\n## Install Node.js\\n\\nOn generic Linux OS, follow installation instructions for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above.\\n\\nThis post was prototyped on DietPi Linux, which currently uses Node.js 20. On DietPi, you may install Node.js as follows:\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo dietpi-software install 9\\n```\\n\\nOr, run `dietpi-software`, select `Search software`, search for `Node.js`, and proceed with installation.\\n\\n## Deploy and run Speakeasy\\n\\nWe need to pick a directory for the application, clone the source to that directory, change some parameters and install.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/src/app/speakeasy/.next\\n```\\n\\nIf your username is joe, you could run it as such. Otherwise, create a non-sudoer account and use that.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo chown -R joe:joe /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\n```\\n\\nThat should allow you to run the rest without using `sudo`.\\n\\nNext, clone the Haven source code, change configuration parameters and run it.\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://git.xx.network/elixxir/speakeasy-web /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\ncd /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\n```\\n\\n### Pick Haven Web application port \\n\\nMost Node.js apps traditionally use port 3000, but you\'ll need something else if you have another app using that port.\\n\\nPick a port for Haven, such as 7080, and use it consistently later:\\n\\n```sh\\nsed -i \'s/next start/next start -p 7080/g\' package.json\\nsed -i \'s/const nextConfig = {/const nextConfig ={\\\\\\\\n  productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,/g\' next.config.js\\nrm -rf node_modules && npm install -g npm@9.6.5 && npm install && npx next telemetry disable && npx next build\\n```\\n\\nIf that went well, you can try to start it from the same directory.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nCheck if Haven is up and running by going to `http://${SERVER_IP}:7080`. You may need to open OS firewall for that. Example for Ubuntu:\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw allow 7080/tcp\\n```\\n\\nSince that port doesn\'t need to be exposed when Speakeasy is running behind HTTPS proxy, it is advisable to delete the rule after testing the application.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw status numbered\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou won\'t be able to do much with Speakeasy running at `http://host:7080` because there\'s no reverse HTTPS proxy in front of Speakeasy. If you attempt to create an identity you will get stuck at the `Find your Codename` step. \\n\\nAssuming the rules for 7080/tcp are number 7 and 8, and your HTTPS reverse proxy will run on the same host, you can delete the rules: `sudo ufw delete 7 ; sudo ufw delete 8`.\\n\\nThe right firewall port to open on the *host* would be whatever port is used by your HTTPS reverse proxy (e.g. 14443).\\n\\n:::tip\\nTo be fully functional, Haven must be accessed through an HTTPS reverse proxy.\\n:::\\n\\n## Reverse HTTPS proxy\\n\\nDeploy reverse HTTPS proxy in front of Speakeasy so that external port is forwarded to Speakeasy\'s application port (example: `https://fqdn:14443` -> `http://localhost:7080`). To use 14443/tcp, open that firewall port on external network.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw allow 14443/tcp\\n```\\n\\nNow configure HTTPS reverse proxy to forward incoming 14443/tcp to 7080/tcp, and if you wish make HTTPS reverse proxy and Speakeasy Web app start (`npm start`) automatically.\\n\\nFor that you may use Caddy, Traefik, NGINX or other. \\n\\nThere are many ways to deploy each reverse proxy and at the same time there are no Speakeasy-specific steps here, so the details are an exercise for the reader. Find and try the official or community examples for your proxy and Node.js.\\n\\n### Custom port, host or path\\n\\nIn the case Speakeasy is the only application proxied by HTTPS reverse proxy, it is most convenient to expose it at `https://host:443`.\\n\\nIn the case the same HTTPS reverse proxy is used for several applications, Speakeasy can be hosted in a directory (or, more complicated, at a dedicated virtual host name or FQDN).\\n\\n### TLS certificate\\n\\nIn any and all cases, your reverse HTTPS proxy would need a TLS certificate.\\n\\nIf your reverse proxy integrates with Let\'s Encrypt, you could expose reverse proxy (and indirectly Speakeasy) to the Internet rather than use internal or even self-signed TLS certificate - it\'s more secure, especially if you additionally protect HTTPS proxy with firewall rules or basic (or other) authentication.\\n\\nHaven Web server doesn\'t host any account or chat data. If you expose Speakeasy to the Internet, the main concern is to prevent NodeJS from application server take-over and tampering, so it can be advantageous to run it using a limited local account, and optionally add some form of authentication to your HTTPS proxy.\\n\\nOnce a TLS-enabled proxy is functional, you can access Haven, create a new codename or import existing, and start using Haven.\\n\\n## Update Haven\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Haven can be simply wiped and re-installed because only serves the application code and does not store any client data.\\n\\nThe official instance (haven.xx.network) normally runs the latest version, so visit that site from time to time, or watch the Speakeasy repository for new releases, or follow xx Network on Twitter."}]}}')}}]);
