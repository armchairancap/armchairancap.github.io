Nodes discard state fairly quickly depending on settings (minutes or hours).\\n\\nFor example, my dump file above contained many entries like these:\\n\\n```raw\\n\\"Error fetching storage: \\n{\\n    \'code\': -32000, \\n    \'message\': \'Client error: UnknownBlock: State already discarded for 0x463b0a5145b3a2b5b8d10e5572122a554f0eb9772712a787b4a6ffd2edc1f2a0\'\\n}\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn order for xxblockdumper to work you need an archive node. \\n\\nAlternatively, if you look for current or very recent blocks and have a fast system, but state pruning timeout is 256 blocks, so for 1 hour you\'d need (60s/6bps)x60 min= 600 at least.\\n\\n```raw\\n./xxnetwork-chain -h | grep pruning\\n      --state-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>\\n          Specify the state pruning mode [default: 256]\\n      --blocks-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>\\n          Specify the blocks pruning mode [default: archive-canonical]\\n```\\n\\n`--blocks-pruning archive` is what will always work, but xx chain node will need hundreds of GBs, possibly on flash media.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nxxblockdumper provides convenience to Python users who want to work with xx chain block data. \\n\\nThere are minor bugs that will be sorted out and then we\'ll be able to use it to build other tools."},{"id":"2024/11/11/xx-dapps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-11-xx-dapps.md","title":"Why dApps for xx Network","description":"Why xx Network is a great platform for private messaging dApps","date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"}],"readingTime":7.78,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/11/11/xx-dapps","title":"Why dApps for xx Network","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain"],"description":"Why xx Network is a great platform for private messaging dApps","keywords":["xx network","chain","dapp","dapps","xx chain","blockchain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dump xx Chain block contents with xxblockdumper","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-chain-block-dumper"},"nextItem":{"title":"NFT-gated access on xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access"}},"content":"- [Intro](#intro)\\n- [Building blocks](#building-blocks)\\n- [Building dApps for xx Network](#building-dapps-for-xx-network)\\n  - [Feature-full native chain](#feature-full-native-chain)\\n  - [Native currency](#native-currency)\\n- [Use cases for these building blocks](#use-cases-for-these-building-blocks)\\n- [Is that legal](#is-that-legal)\\n- [Summary](#summary)\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nAs [Hacktoberfest 2024 just finished](/blog/2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites) and I\'ve churned out some more or less coherent stuff for it, I want to share a few very short additional notes about it here.\\n\\n## Building blocks\\n\\nxx Network has a mixnet (which in turn has an SDK called xxDK) which applications use to work with cMixx.\\n\\nxx chain is a Polkadot SDK-based (aka Substrate-based) chain which has its own ecosystem, libraries, API.\\n\\nApplications can use xxDK to send messages on xx Network for free, so there\'s no need to write to xx chain or own XX coins. It is expected that only power-users [may have](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#postage) the need to buy XX coin to pay, which is to say casual use should never require anything but xxDK.\\n\\nWhat does that mean for dApp authors? I think that means xx Network is a good platform for messaging dApps. \\n\\n## Building dApps for xx Network\\n\\nUsually the fact that xx Network is \\"bootstrapped\\" in a blockchain elicits negative comments (see [these examples](/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh#techloretech)), if any at all. \\n\\nMost people have no opinion about that, which isn\'t much better. It\'s a major difference and has to be considered. If you have good reasons why being blockchain-based is bad, that\'s fine as well.\\n\\nI think it has a very positive impact that may not be obvious if you haven\'t thought about it and all you\'ve heard is \\"crypto is full of scams\\". \\n\\nFor example, I happen to think that xx Network (and the Foundation) has a better setup than Signal and their foundation. Let\'s take a look at some more practical differences between xx Network and chainless apps.\\n\\n### Feature-full native chain\\n\\nxx Network is are one of very few networks that provide anonymous messaging *and* have its own L1 chain to work with.\\n\\nxx Network has a *good* (Substrate-based), fast, low-cost chain with plenty of features - from assets to governance - so for many use cases entire apps can be written to it without using anything else. \\n\\nMost other decentralized private messaging guys have to write dApps for 3rd party chains - which we can do, too - and we do not. More choice.\\n\\nThe PoC code for [XX token- and asset-gating](/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access/) of Web sites shows how easy Polkadot-style dApps can work with xx Network - it wasn\'t too hard to modify the app for xx Network and add asset-gating. It would also be easy to modify that code to use asset-gating on other Substrate-based channels with asset support. \\n\\n### Native currency\\n\\nMost other private messaging apps don\'t have a native currency, so they have to pick a wallet and integrate with another chain. \\n\\nxxDK dApps can do that as well, but it\'s simple enough to use xx chain, especially if you need to handle postage that I mentioned earlier - in that case your app may be able to use one wallet and one currency.\\n\\nOnce XX coin gets listed on a DEX, it will be easy to acquire XX coin with any major crypto-currency and use it to pay postage (when it becomes available), so using xxDK from a dApp that defaults to other coins isn\'t any different from using other similar networks.\\n\\n## Use cases for these building blocks\\n\\nI mentioned some of them in the token-gating post, but I\'ll make one additional example here to illustrate why I worked on those \\"building blocks\\" recently - we can put them together to build some simple dApps (or semi-dApps). \\n\\n- It is easy to download a file, but if you need to do it reasonably privately, you can use [Tribler](/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler#whats-tribler)\\n  - The challenge is getting the link equally (or more) privately\\n  - Find me in my Haven Space, pay me some coins, and I\'ll seed the file for you in Tribler (and give you the link). I can automate this completely as I explained in the Hacktoberfest post, or I can make it fully manual (which is necessary for on-demand items), semi-automated, or AI-powered\\n- If you need even more privacy for downloads, you can park them on S3 and use an asset-gated Web site in the public cloud\\n- If you need even more privacy, you can run [xx Haven container and Web service on Onion network](/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not#how-it-could-be-done)\\n- If you want to use a Web3 app without using public cloud, you can create an app that uses xxDK for chat and something like Crust Network to share content\\n\\nWith XX chain (or other Substrate-chain) asset-gating we an even serve the same content using [different routes (links) for different membership levels](https://github.com/armchairancap/polkadot-js-tokengated-website/issues/2) all on xx Network.\\n\\n## Is that legal\\n\\nOf course, some will inevitably think \\"crypto is only good for scams and crime\\".\\n\\nI wouldn\'t be posting about this if I couldn\'t think of a lawful use case. \\n\\nThere are valid use cases for rare or unique data that can\'t be free (because it may require 100s of GBs in egress bandwidth).\\n\\nThere are dApps that specialize in blobs (Storj, etc.), but there are use cases where data has to be posted on demand.\\n\\nIn other cases you may not want to charge for egress in dApp, so you could use Tribler. Or you may want to speed up seeding in an ad-hoc manner, which is very easy to do in a community-powered way. Put a file on Tribler, share the link in a Haven space and ask everyone to help out:\\n- no crypto-currency involved\\n- zero barrier to entry - one free app to install (Tribler), no wallet to create, no DEX/CEX or any registration to use\\n\\nSo, it\'s not at all true there are no lawful use cases here. \\n\\nxxNetwork cMixx is used mostly to share links or other metadata that benefits from its PQE and mixnet. It could be used for paid access to low-bandwidth data feeds, but I did not consider such use cases in this post.\\n\\nLegal uses with P2P payments are also possible. In xx Network validator community there have been multiple occasions where people needed to download a copy of xx Chain faster than xx Chain could download it on its own: if you don\'t get ready by next validator election deadline you may not get elected and lose 50 XX by not validating, so paying 25 XX to get it faster would have saved validators money.\\n\\nStorj egress is $0.007/GB, so 200GB is $1.4, and about $0.8 to upload. $2.2 is still very cheap, but with some friction for both sides (Storj account setup, payment, setup).\\n\\nHaven-Tribler:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n  participant Alice\\n  participant Bob\\n  Alice->>Bob: Bob, how much to seed xx Chain block archive for 48h?\\n  Bob--\x3e>Alice: 100 XX, 10 MB/s. Tell me your address. I\'m BlockchainBob on xx Chain.\\n  Alice->>Bob: AstroAlice, 6xyz...123. Sending in 30 seconds!\\n  Bob--\x3e>Alice: 200 GiB archive. Can put it on Backblaze for 200 XX and 30 MB/s, if you want.\\n  Alice->>Bob: Tribler is fine, thanks! \\n  Bob--\x3e>Alice: (verifies payment, creates torrent in Tribler, shares Magnet link in Haven)\\n```\\n\\nIf they were Solana validators they would pay with Solana because that\'s what they already have ready to go. That doesn\'t change anything.\\n\\n:::note\\nThere\'s nothing confidential in xx Chain archive files. Anyone with the magnet link could \\"leech\\" off Bob\'s seeding, but unless they\'re malicious they can only speed up Alice\'s download.\\n\\nWorst case: they stand up several leeching clients, making Bob\'s seeding slower. But, how could they get the magnet link if not from Alice? Because Bob used Haven to share the link to Alice, it couldn\'t have been intercepted. \\n\\nIf the attackers knew Alice was going to pay Bob for this service, they could monitor torrent announcements on Tribler and tried their luck with every large archive.zip that\'s over 100 GB... And it\'s easy to defeat with simple Zip file encryption in any case.\\n:::\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nSo we have everything you need and there\'s no need to use any other network, right? \\n\\nWrong! I\'m not an XX coin maximalist, folks. \\n\\nI\'d never \\"encourage\\" you to use or buy XX coin. If you - a user or developer - think that it would help you, use it. \\n\\nI only want to share why I think xx Network mixnet is quite unique in its approach. It does give you more flexibility and more convenience. \\n\\nAnyone can build for xxDK and use (or not) whatever crypto currency they like in their dApp. They can also use several - for example:\\n  - some currency which is their first choice\\n  - XX coin for xx Postage \\n  - Crust for blob storage\\n  - Ethereum for ENS (name and reputation)\\n\\nAny permutation of these will work, and not having any coin will also work (Haven + Tribler, for example).\\n\\nWith just a couple of building blocks we can build reasonably private dApps. \\n\\nSome other building blocks I\'d like to see (not a complete list):\\n\\n- Reputation (maybe through Ethereum ENS)\\n- Identity (maybe on Polkadot or Ethereum ENS) for easier\\n- Blob app integration (add xxDK chat to Crust app, or run Haven + Crust in the same browser tab)\\n\\nIf you have own ideas, check out [the xx Foundation Grant program](https://xxfoundation.org/xx-grants-program-reboot/) or reach out on X or the XX Discord."},{"id":"2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access.md","title":"NFT-gated access on xx Network","description":"","date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"xx chain","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-chain"},{"label":"nft","permalink":"/blog/tags/nft"},{"label":"asset","permalink":"/blog/tags/asset"}],"readingTime":8.925,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access","title":"NFT-gated access on xx Network","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","xx chain","nft","asset"],"description":"","keywords":["xx network","speakeasy","docker","container","server","instance","haven"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why dApps for xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps"},"nextItem":{"title":"Notes on forked comparison of messengers","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes"}},"content":"- [Tokens, assets, NFTs, WTF](#tokens-assets-nfts-wtf)\\n- [Token-gated access control](#token-gated-access-control)\\n- [Asset-gated access control](#asset-gated-access-control)\\n- [Query (check asset balances)](#query-check-asset-balances)\\n- [Buying and selling assets on xx chain](#buying-and-selling-assets-on-xx-chain)\\n- [Dealing with subscription expiration](#dealing-with-subscription-expiration)\\n- [Use cases](#use-cases)\\n- [Alien assets and NFTs](#alien-assets-and-nfts)\\n- [Summary](#summary)\\n\\n\\n## Tokens, assets, NFTs, WTF\\n\\nxx Network has its native currency XX coin, assets and NFTs.

Piss off!\\n\\nBut what about them \\"soulbound tokens\\"? \\n\\nThat\'s a different lookup/API, for \\"assets\\" rather than \\"token\\" balances (for XX).\\n\\n## Asset-gated access control\\n\\n:::note\\nThis really means token-gated (with \\"assets\\").\\n:::\\n\\nWe can also limit access to hodlers of certain assets, and by that I mean token-like assets available on xx Network.\\n\\nIn the case you\'ve been so engaged that you missed their existence, you can find them in xx Network Wallet under Network > Assets.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access-01.png)\\n\\nLet\'s consider two, `test` (ID: 4) and `Intelligence` (ID: 42).\\n\\nWe need to know how to query their balance in user\'s wallet.\\n\\nFor the impatient JS users - find sample JS code in the same repository.\\n\\n## Query (check asset balances)\\n\\nIt\'s unbelievable and ludicrous, but it took me many hours to find this info. As if no one needs this stuff.\\n\\nI find that hard to believe! But look above - after several years of mainnet and there\'s just half a dozen test-grade assets, so maybe that\'s true?\\n\\nAnyway, let\'s go:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom substrateinterface import SubstrateInterface\\n\\nsubstrate = SubstrateInterface(\\n    url=\\"ws://192.168.1.30:63007\\"\\n)\\n\\n# Asset test\\nASSET_ID = 4  # asset ID: test\\nACCOUNT = \'6Xo3ESdU9nW3iiAk5ZqDA7kKqYJMcJFGiRz91LkoZKvvTjAV\' # owner / issuer\\naccount_info = substrate.query(\\n    module=\'Assets\',\\n    storage_function=\'Account\',\\n    params=[ASSET_ID, ACCOUNT],\\n)\\n\\nprint(f\'Balance: {account_info[\\"balance\\"]}\')\\n# Balance: 100000000000\\n\\n# Asset Intelligence\\nASSET_ID = 42  # asset ID: Intelligence\\nACCOUNT = \'6ZsMetbm4yoj9JQJdmhn2dKScFNkUnxULXwTBsNpmL1FM3KY\' # owner / issuer\\n\\naccount_info = substrate.query(\\n    module=\'Assets\',\\n    storage_function=\'Account\',\\n    params=[ASSET_ID, ACCOUNT],\\n)\\n\\nprint(f\'Balance: {account_info[\\"balance\\"]}\')\\n# Balance: 42\\n```\\n\\nAll right!!! I think this should work for other addresses (not just the owner) but I don\'t know if any of these owners have sent them to other people.\\n\\nHey, that issuance amount of `test` looks weird - how come there\'s 100000000000 of \'em when the screenshot says 100?\\n\\nThe reason is assets may have different properties. We can use TFM (where is it?) or try the \\"create asset\\" workflow to see what goes in.\\n\\n![xx Network asset create options](/img/blog/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access-02.png)\\n\\nSo, it appears `Intelligence` is an integer-based asset, while `test` has a crapload of decimals. \\n\\nThat\'s good to know, but it doesn\'t matter much to us in this particular workflow: we don\'t need to know how to look up an asset\'s properties as we usually accept one or more known assets. If you\'re interested in that, however, find it [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/storage/#assets) - it\'s `api.query.assets.metadata` (in JavaScript). Polkadot.js API details related to assets can be found in [the repo](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/blob/9becdced121977a22c81df4d037c9d0e60b370a5/packages/types/src/interfaces/assets/definitions.ts#L1).\\n\\nIn JS I managed to do this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from \\"@polkadot/api\\";\\nimport type { StorageKey, u32 } from \'@polkadot/types\';\\nconst assetDetails = await api.query.assets.asset(assetId);\\nconsole.table(assetDetails.toHuman());\\nconst assetMetadata = await api.query.assets.metadata(assetId);\\nconsole.table(assetMetadata.toHuman());\\n```\\n.. and get this.

I\'m not sure how to do that. \\n\\nOTC to the rescue! Create and publish [Haven](https://haven.xx.network) Space address for your OTC store and sell assets there. It sucks, but it can be automated. How?\\n\\nYou can build a bot - I once created a crude one - that reads comments in your channel and sells this stuff.\\n\\nPrice list for your Validator Monthly Intelligence newsletter:\\n\\n- Basic subscription - 10 XX/mo\\n- Premium - 100 XX/mo\\n\\nBuyer says \\"I\'ve transferred 10 XX (extrinsic hash attached), please credit me 1 Intelligence to this address 6ZLG..\\":\\n\\n```raw\\n/buy 1 Intelligence 6VwDT9VMgPrswqtJtqUH4PU7DkcaHggJjyjnkuUZyNA5c5j1 \\\\\\n    0xaba65810f33f905e2d136e6a12c0a7e4ae7111a4f6c59415ffa83a3d0d7663c0\\n```\\n\\nThe bot checks that transaction (everything checks out, 10XX received). It mints 1 Intelligence to 6ZLGrh6Mu7uDioL7bAVS4kTsRSez7w1Lz18fiApUqRHNWnxd and appends an extrinsic hash and timestamp for easier troubleshooting.\\n\\n```raw\\n/mint 1 6VwDT9VMgPrswqtJtqUH4PU7DkcaHggJjyjnkuUZyNA5c5j1 \\\\\\n    0xaba65810f33f905e2d136e6a12c0a7e4ae7111a4f6c59415ffa83a3d0d7663c0 {timestamp}\\n```\\n\\nIf something fails, Haven keeps data for 21 days so there\'s enough time to chit-chat in another Space (for human-powered support) where refunds and other issues can be dealt with.\\n\\nI\'m sure there are some edge cases I haven\'t thought of, but there\'s no reason why this can\'t work and there must be some detailed production-worthy examples in other ecosystems.\\n\\nAnyway, let\'s move on. As Teddy KGB said, \\"Pay him... Pay that man his fxxxing money\\". Or send the man his freaking asset:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom substrateinterface import SubstrateInterface\\n\\nKEYPAIR = \'....\'\\n\\n# Asset: Intelligence\\nASSET_ID = 5  \\nASSET_QTY = 1\\n# Subscriber\'s wallet to use in Polkadot{.js} for authorization\\nSUBSCRIBER_ID = \'6VwDT9VMgPrswqtJtqUH4PU7DkcaHggJjyjnkuUZyNA5c5j1\'\\n\\ncall = substrate.compose_call(\\n    call_module=\\"Assets\\",\\n    call_function=\\"transfer\\",\\n    call_params={\'id\': ASSET_ID, \'target\': SUBSCRIBER_ID, \'amount\': ASSET_QTY}\\n)\\n\\nextrinsic = substrate.create_signed_extrinsic(call=call, keypair=KEYPAIR, era={\'period\': 64})\\nresult = substrate.submit_extrinsic(extrinsic, wait_for_inclusion=True)\\n```\\n\\nI haven\'t tried this one yet, by the way.\\n\\nI\'m not sure about the difference between minting and transferring - obviously the former increments the issuance while the latter sends existing, but I haven\'t looked at the minting API in Python yet. I wonder if minting is a term for asset transfer (I hope not, as it implies additional issuance).\\n\\n## Dealing with subscription expiration\\n\\nYes, there are more problems... \\n\\nNext month that guy will still have his 1 Intelligence. But we need to charge him again. What can we do?\\n\\nNormally we\'d use \\"Smart Contracts\\", but we can\'t (or at least I don\'t know how to do that on xx chain), so we have to come up with workarounds such as:\\n\\n- Check for a new token (Intelligence-Jan, Intelligence-Feb) every month (you can pre-release, and not sell, 12 of them at once), or\\n- Sell 12 month subscriptions and issue a new asset every year , or\\n- Buy back tokens at a tiny fraction of the original price, or\\n- Check date of last pay the wallet did as well as the balance (complicated)\\n\\n:::note\\nI wonder if 21 day subscription periods would be better than customary 30 day periods, because Haven retains server-side chat data that long. \\nIf bots work well, 30 days or longer shouldn\'t be a problem.\\n:::\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\nFew wallets have good reputation, but there are folks out there who could probably charge for monthly subscription. \\n\\n- Newsletter (say, monthly validator analysis for stakers/nominators)\\n- xx chain-related reports (nominator pays 10xx for staking payouts and Web reports/stats, for example)\\n- Discord bots for asset-gated access to special channels\\n- Private training/consulting (for Haven admins and users, e.g. 1 unit of an asset buys you 1 minute)\\n- Classic \\"soulbound\\" assets given away for free (no OTC trading necessary)\\n\\nManaged Haven instance hosting sounds like another possibility, but that idea sucks:\\n\\n- It requires absolute trust\\n- Users who access such instances immediately identify themselves by their wallet ID (and xx is not a privacy coin) and maybe IP address, browser fingerprint and more\\n\\n## Alien assets and NFTs\\n\\nPolkadot has a rich asset/NFT ecosystem that can do more and even has bridges to other L1 chains (alien NFTs, one might say).\\n\\nWhile that\'s nice, it\'s more than we need here. \\n\\nOf course, xx chain could adopt some of those features, but I think it objectively doesn\'t need them.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn xx Network wallet NFTs are there (based on the xxchain code pallet-nfts v4.0.0 is used), but there\'s no way to issue them from the wallet. You can find the NFT Pallet documentation [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nft-pallets#nfts-pallet), just mind the fact that xx Network Wallet won\'t let owners see them unless wallet itself gets some upgrades.\\n\\nAs we\'ve seen assets exist, but aren\'t likely to be used as \\"assets\\". \\n\\n![xx Network Wallet with assets and NFTs](/img/blog/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access-04.png)\\n\\nThe xx Network community hasn\'t done much to monetize Web (or should I say \\"Web3\\" to highlight my \\"DeFi\\" prowess) access. \\n\\nOne of the reasons is surely lack of examples and documentation, and another is a small market size.\\n\\nWith XX coin-gated and NFT-gated apps (based on xx \\"assets\\"), that is easy to do now. Get the code [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/polkadot-js-tokengated-website/tree/v1.2.1).\\n\\nMarket for xx chain-related token- and NFT-gated services (based on xx chain \\"assets\\") is still small, but it does exist. Anyone who builds something and makes it available for others, lowers the entry barrier for more xx Network services. Let us hope such services emerge in coming months."},{"id":"2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-01-haven-comparison-notes.md","title":"Notes on forked comparison of messengers","description":"Note on Notification if contact\'s fingerprint changes and other items","date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"haven","permalink":"/blog/tags/haven"},{"label":"speakeasy","permalink":"/blog/tags/speakeasy"}],"readingTime":4.94,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes","title":"Notes on forked comparison of messengers","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","haven","speakeasy"],"description":"Note on Notification if contact\'s fingerprint changes and other items","keywords":["xx network","speakeasy","comparison","haven"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NFT-gated access on xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access"},"nextItem":{"title":"Good Hacktoberfest 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/01/my-hacktober-2024-activites"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n  - [Wait, I can\'t run Haven on mobile?](#wait-i-cant-run-haven-on-mobile)\\n- [Notes](#notes)\\n  - [Notification if contact\'s fingerprint changes](#notification-if-contacts-fingerprint-changes)\\n  - [Find/add contacts](#findadd-contacts)\\n  - [Supported push notification services](#supported-push-notification-services)\\n  - [Legal jurisdication](#legal-jurisdication)\\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nToday I [forked and published](https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html) a comparison of various messengers. Why? \\n\\nBecause as the author of the original comparison can\'t possibly include everything (he actually checks and compares all those details, which requires non-trivial efforts) and he focuses on major messengers so Haven\'t currently isn\'t included. (He welcomes requests, so you could suggest Haven - Haven\'t (pun intended).)\\n\\nNot having a mobile version probably doesn\'t help.\\n\\n### Wait, I can\'t run Haven on mobile?\\n\\nAs of today, yes. I mean, you *can* run Haven on mobile Android and Linux devices with WASM-capable browsers, but the UI isn\'t responsive and it doesn\'t attempt to save battery, so it won\'t be pretty.\\n\\nxx Messenger was a mobile app that would probably have done well in a comparison, but it used an older xxDK and is no longer maintained.\\n\\nHaven is the main reference application for xx Network confidential & private messaging. There\'s a patch for responsive UI which was delivered as part of Hacktoberfest 2024 activities, but it hasn\'t been merged yet. Keep an eye on that in coming weeks - if merged, that would make Haven more suitable - although just the UI - for Android browsers with WASM support.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the main topic, which is I wanted to create a post with some notes regarding the Haven column in that comparison page.\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nThese are notes that clarify some of the values I picked for the Haven column in that comparison chart.\\n\\n### Notification if contact\'s fingerprint changes\\n\\nMost people have tried Signal. If you swap your phone or such, your Signal chat counterparts will be informed that your \\"fingerprint\\" changed. There\'s no such thing on cMixx (and in Haven).\\n\\nHaven [identity](/docs/haven-user-guide/identity) *is* the only user-facing cryptographic identity. \\n\\nYou can\'t \\"\\"change\\" a fingerprint or anything like that. If you lose access to your identity (forget the password to encrypted identity file, or lose the identity file), you must assume a different identity. In that case there\'s no mechanism for you to rejoin a private Space (1-on-1 or group chat) and message contacts saying \\"this identity replaces this other identity\\". Who can tell if that\'s the same person?\\n\\nIf you have backups of the invite links and pass phrases you can rejoin those spaces using the new identity. But there\'s no way for others to know if the new identity is owned by the same person. \\n\\nThe only way to do this is to use the old identity to message everyone \\"from now on, I\'ll be using this new identity\\". \\n\\nAnother way is to use an [external identity service](https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/haven-user-guide/identity_external) where people can look up identities you claim on xx Network. But that assumes they know your external identity. \\n\\n### Find/add contacts\\n\\nSee the previous point - there\'s no name service in Haven, so you can\'t \\"find\\" anyone. \\n\\nYou can use external identity services mentioned just above.\\n\\nxx Messenger [had this custom IDs](https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/idCollisionAndNotifications), but Haven does not. Personally I don\'t miss those - I think external ID services are the way to go because messenger contacts are just one of many things you need to have an address book for. \\n\\nSince Haven is one of few messengers that is anchored in a blockchain, knowing someone\'s cMixx name is not enough. We want their wallet addresses (probably not just for xx coin, but for several currencies), their ENS name, and other public Web3 data they choose to publish. \\n\\nWhy you can\'t \\"add\\" contacts either? Well, we\'d need to sync them somewhere. xx Messenger could upload (backup) its data to S3, so contacts could be saved as well. \\n\\nxx Haven currently doesn\'t do that so contacts must be searched in external services where people publish their Haven identities. That location is a matter of choice as well - not just in terms of usability, but also privacy, cost, and more. Having to publish your data on ENS (and pay that fee) may or may not be liked by all users which is why I think Haven should leave those integrations to other cMixx messengers when they appear. I don\'t mind looking it up in whatever way is convenient for me and my contacts.\\n\\n### Supported push notification services\\n\\nxx Messenger used a centralized push service, but Haven doesn\'t currently doesn\'t have it which means it\'s limited to constant polling which is power-consuming. \\n\\nThat doesn\'t matter much for desktops (there\'s more \\"unnecessary\\" activity from [Cover Traffic](https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/coverTraffic) than from notifications), but matters on mobile devices. \\n\\n### Legal jurisdication\\n\\nThe xx Foundation is a non-profit in the USA.\\n\\nMixnet round scheduling is done by the Foundation and that server is - if I\'m not mistaken - in located the EU. The scheduling node isn\'t involved in data handling.\\n\\nClient-side ecrypted user data has five copies per each cMixx round and so user data from each conversation lives in dozens of jurisdications (see [the cMix dashboard](https://dashboad.xx.network)). The scheduling server doesn\'t know which messages went into which mixnet round - only the sender and recepient(s) do, so those not included in a conversation wouldn\'t even know where encrypted data is.\\n\\nEncrypted data is kept on cMixx gateways for 21 days after which only local (cached) copies may remain on participants\' clients.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI obviously don\'t speak for the author of the original document, so the values I picked for Haven are my own.\\n\\nThis post elaborates on all the rows where I felt felt sharing some notes would be helpful.

I think there is: one UI with Haven and Tribler:\\n\\n- Someone posts RSS feed into a private (or public) Haven Space (\\"chat channel\\")\\n- Users copy links and download them using Tribler \\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nIdeally, Haven could run inside of Tribler. But the Tribler project would have to make that happen. Alternatively, someone could create and maintain a patch. Not very good.\\n\\nAnother way is to create a small patch to Tribler menus and run Haven in an iFrame.\\n\\nAnother way is to run Tribler in a Haven iFrame. That\'s easier, but you have to create a small patch for Haven, which some privacy-sensitive people may not like.\\n\\n### Pros and cons of DIY approaches\\n\\nA Haven iFrame in Tribler chat menu is available [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-tribler-haven/releases/tag/v1.0). I call this attempt v1.0. \\n\\nYou click on the chat cloud icion and Haven opens in the main pane (iFrame).\\n\\n![Tribler with a Haven iFrame](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/tribler-with-haven-iframe.png)\\n\\n- Step 1: join a Haven Space (\\"chat channel\\")\\n- Step 2: find a magnet link\\n- Step 3: paste it into \\"Add torrent\\" \\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in\\n\\nDo you see what I mean? If your use case is \\"get into a Haven Space, get one link, copy it to Tribler and leave Haven\\", this is actually a good approach. All it takes to secure access to Haven is to navigate away: you won\'t leave Haven iFrame open because in order to use that Magnet link you\'ll have to leave it. Just make sure your Haven profile password is strong!\\n\\nNote that this only hides your Haven identity, Spaces, and chat data, while Tribler UI is still running and downloaded data is on disk. \\n\\nThe second approach I tried - a Tribler iFrame in Haven - works the other way around, except there\'s no state in Tribler (it\'s a server-based application with a Web UI) so if you download multiple torrents or like to chat with Space members as you download, this may be better for you. \\n\\n![Haven with a Tribler iFrame](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/haven-with-tribler-iframe.png)\\n\\nJoin a channel, get your links, download them in Tribler and watch/manage downloads as they go.\\n\\nIn this approach there\'s a small patch to Haven which seems low-risk to me if you\'re the only user of your Haven instance: you own the Haven instance and you own the Tribler instance as well, so as long as you\'re not concerned about Tribler in a Haven iFrame, I think patching Haven and using it this way is fine.\\n\\nI\'m working on finalizing these small patches in another release at the same location as v1.0.\\n\\n### Do we actually need any integration?\\n\\nThat\'s a good question. If you don\'t use both of these applications at the same time often, it\'s probably best to use them separately and avoid complications.\\n\\nAs an example of yet other approaches, I\'ve built a simple browser extension which downloads selected (Magnet) links using Tribler: very easy to use, no patches required. But you can\'t see or control what\'s going on with downloads without going to another tab or window with Tribler UI. \\n\\nI couldn\'t load Haven in this \\"preview\\" version of Firefox (WASM issues), but this is how simple the extension is: select a Magnet link in Haven chat and use the extension to initiate Tribler download.\\n\\n![Download with Tribler Extension](./2024-10-29-xx-network-haven-tribler/haven-with-browser-extension.png)\\n\\nThis can work anywhere including the \\"Haven with a Tribler iFrame\\" approach because it simply talks to the Tribler API and Tribler UI doesn\'t need to be visible. It saves some copy-and-paste even if Tribler runs in the same browser tab as Haven. I\'ve posted a proof-of-concept version [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/magnet-link-downloader-tribler-firefox) - see the link for the details.\\n\\nIf you\'re a security freak, I won\'t try to persuade you to use these iFrame approaches.\\n\\n## Security concerns\\n\\nIt is possible that the app in iFrame does something to its parent frame. If you worry about that, of course just run the apps separately or even in different VMs.\\n\\nIn the \\"Haven with a Tribler iFrame\\" approach we could tighten the iFrame CORS, and also properly integrate applications so that we don\'t have to skip authentication from `localhost` clients on Tribler (which I currently do). I\'ll post the patches in the repo for easy reviewing. Risk of someone else accessing your instance of Tribler on `localhost` (where Haven is running) through Haven iFrame should be extremely low, though. \\n\\nAnd this instance of Tribler should not listen on public IPs - simply close off its Web UI and IP ports.\\n\\nIf you want to let others access Haven on the same computer, you could simply start another container binding a public IP and port. The same goes for extra Tribler instances.\\n\\nIn a crazy mix-up setup you could run a \\"groupware edition\\" of Haven-Tribler compose.yaml:\\n\\n- Haven-Tribler setup for multiple users (who all share same Tribler and can be in the same channel if they\'re all focused on same content)\\n- One Web server gateway sharing static content (Tribler download directory) for authenticated downloads\\n\\nThat would be as secure as the stupidest downloader.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nHaven provides private and confidential access to Magnet links that can be used in Tribler: free access, post-quantum E2EE, and metadata shredding eliminate the need to use Tor, VPNs or privacy-leaking Web sites.\\n\\nAmong DIY approaches at lightweight integration:\\n\\n- For single-torrent and one-off use, Tribler with a Haven iFrame is a good approach which forces inconvenience (and results in good SecOps)\\n- For parallel use (Haven + Tribler) and multiple downloads, I like Haven with a Tribler iFrame because it gives me full control over Tribler\\n- For \\"hidden Tribler\\" we can run Haven + browser extension that hooks into the Tribler API, but you\'d want extra controls and visibility into downloads, which means either occasional access to Tribler UI or a fat extension with some Tribler indicators similar to \\"Down Them All\\" or such (which is complex)."},{"id":"2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-13-bip-utils-with-xx-network.md","title":"Use BIP39 from bip-utils with xx Network","description":"How to use bip-utils with xx network","date":"2024-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":0.865,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/10/13/bip-utils-with-xx-network","title":"Use BIP39 from bip-utils with xx Network","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"How to use bip-utils with xx network","keywords":["xx network","xx chain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Haven with Tribler","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler"},"nextItem":{"title":"A comparison between Nym and xx Network","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork"}},"content":"## bip-utils\\n\\n[bip-utils](https://github.com/ebellocchia/bip_utils) allows generating mnemonics, seeds, private/public keys and addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies, including Substrate-based currencies.\\n\\n## xx Network support\\n\\nI added it to a fork [here](https://github.com/armchairancap/bip_utils_xx/commit/6b15ab0d26aa8a75238a1047336e82e1549c79bc).

You may want to do your own comparison vs. Mullvad VPN or other VPN service.\\n\\n### Blockchain\\n\\nThis isn\'t important for end users, but Polkadot (used by xx Network) has a bigger ecosystem compared to Cosmos.\\n\\nGovernance and integrations seem better on Polkadot and that\'s why it\'s been relatively easy for xx Network to create integrations (bridge) with Ripple and Ethereum, for example. I expect this will continue simply because xx Network leverages a superior blockchain platform (Polkadot).\\n\\n### Validators\\n\\nNym is still running a permissioned network that\'s smaller than xx Network\'s. In this regard, they\'re behind.\\n\\nPerhaps out of necessity, Nym has a more restricted entry and exit conditions for validators. I actually like how they do this and I think it\'s better than xx Network. Highlights:\\n\\n> New validators can join via a NYM-to-NYX swap contract. The contract will not allow more than 1% of total stake increase per month to prevent sudden hostile takeovers.\\n\\n> The contract will only allow swapping NYM to NYX and will not allow exchanging NYX back to NYM. A NYX holder who wishes to sell their NYX stake will have to do so via OTC trades.\\n\\nYou may say this doesn\'t prevent indirect hoarding of coins, but at least at this moment (because the network is permissioned with KYC, it appears) they can control this better. xx Network has some small pools that should be banned from the network, but the problem probably isn\'t significant enough to motivate the community to move against it.\\n\\nxx Network is permissionless as far as staking and identity are concerned. So, although Nym\'s rules and controls seem helpful, they may not be possible to implement on xx Network or a permissionless Nym network. We\'ll see how Nym adjusts to permissionless life (if they ever get there).\\n\\n### Services\\n\\nNym provides a Wireguard-based VPN routed over their network, which xx Network doesn\'t do. \\n\\nWhile this seems great - you don\'t need to buy Mullvad or other VPN subscription, for example - it\'s a trap. \\n\\nNot for the users, but for Nym Tech and their community whose nodes provide that service. \\n\\nI don\'t think they\'ll be able to pull this off because bandwidth requirements will be huge and there\'s no way operators who operate VPN entry/exit nodes can do that with residential connections. What does that mean?\\n\\nThat means SPs or the cloud, and that means they\'ll need to be paid.\\n\\nBut, now you have KYC + getting paid for VPN + risk of illegal use (which they can\'t really monitor because it\'s encrypted and censorship-free). Do you see where this is going? \\n\\nDo you want to make $500/mo and deal with daily DMCA notices and maybe even police inquiries? Not many people do, unless they\'re based in a 3rd world country.\\n\\nI don\'t know how they\'re going to pull that off. If I was them I\'d allow only whitelisted destinations, but for most of those people don\'t really need to use VPNs. \\n\\nWe\'ll see. I\'m skeptical.\\n\\n### Integrations\\n\\nI haven\'t done a deep dive on these, but:\\n\\n- Nym is ahead in VPN-related integrations simply because there\'s not much to integrate and xx Network doesn\'t have that integration to begin with\\n- Mixnet integrations are hard to compare because they\'re dissimilar and each platform has a few so maybe it\'s fair to say it\'s roughly even\\n\\nxx Network has wallet integrations through Proxxy (cMix-backed API proxy), while Nym\'s own wallet natively uses Nym\'s mixnet (and they have Zk-nyms), so in wallet integrations they\'re likely better.\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nxx Network doesn\'t have blockchain privacy features. This decision was deliberate - I wrote about it [here](/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view).\\n\\nNym has zk-nyms which makes it a privacy-capable coin and therefore a candidate for delisting (or harder listing) on centralized exchanges. \\n\\nIf you need a VPN, you can get Mullvad VPN and pay with Monero. If you\'re a Nym VPN user, then it appears you can buy Nym VPN credits with Zcash.\\n\\nBoth approaches work, but with Nym you can buy both VPN and pay for mixnet services with one coin. Now you may say \\"I prefer Monero and Mullvad\\", but that\'s a matter of preference and convenience.\\n\\nxx coin, the native currency of xx chain, may add privacy features in the future but it\'s been de-prioritized to avoid regulatory and listing challenges. \\n\\nOne valid point in Nym\'s material is that you can acquire their coin and pay for services without being tracked. xx Network can\'t do that. At the same time, xx Network cMix service is still free, so there\'s nothing to pay for. You still *don\'t need* any xx coin to use xx Network in the first place!\\n\\n### Mixnet \\n\\nFirst, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a to-do item for Nym, and implemented in xx Network\'s cMix. \\n\\nSecond, Nym\'s network is still centralized, so every single validator is known. Said differently: Nym mixing is decentralized, but all the mixers are known.\\n\\nThird, in their [litepaper](https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf), they have a comparison between cMix (mixnet used by xx Network) and their modified 3rd party design (based on [Loopix](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-piotrowska.pdf)). I\'m not qualified to evaluate that, so I won\'t. \\n\\nAnd then there\'s this thing below. As a reminder: their litepaper was published (updated?) in 2023, so it\'s not like they\'ve missed anything because it didn\'t exist in mid 2023. \\n\\nIn the table below they refer to Elixxir (which was the company behind xx Network/cMix early on) although xx Network has become foundation-managed years ago and Elixxir no long plays a role. Maybe using a prehistoric name is a way to say \\"we created that in 2019 and forgot to update\\". Well, you didn\'t and your litepaper was published on Nov 2, 2023. \\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-08-20-nym-vs-cmix.png)\\n\\nLet\'s see:\\n\\n- **1 - Incentivised relays** - xx Network has had that for years. Validators stake themselves and get staked by other coin holders. They get rewarded for authoring blocks on xx chain and relaying cMix messages. [In coming quarters](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage/) postage for premium tier users.\\n- **2 - Scalable network** - xx Network has almost 400 nodes - more than enough for its traffic needs - and it doesn\'t seem not scalable (or whatever is the opposite from scalable). For a mixnet focused on short messages (whether it\'s text messages or API calls), it seems scalable enough to me.\\n- **3 - Secure and efficient encryption protocol** - As I\'ve mentioned earlier Nym claims their approach has a higher efficiency which I am unable to judge, but they don\'t have post-quantum encryption so even it it\'s more efficient, is it more secure across the board? It\'s a blanket statement. Not to mention that xx Network\'s cMix was developed in-house by Dr. Chaum and is still being developed (this includes development for [three Worldcoin grants](/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage)), while Nym\'s is a modified implementation of a 3rd party invention.\\n- **4 - Community governance of the relay nodes** - xx Network has had this for years and Polkadot has better governance features than Cosmos.\\n- **5 - Large anonymity set** - xx Network currently uses 5 nodes and most messages generally delivered within 3 seconds (see Real Time (round) component in the [xx Network dashboard](https://dashboard.xx.network) - mean 24h latency is currently 2.12s). That seems enough for the use cases targeted by xx Network (chat, API proxy, voting, etc.), and can be increased. I don\'t know how large (it\'s not in the litepaper and I didn\'t try very hard to find that information elsewhere) Nym\'s anonymity sets are, so this advantage isn\'t quantified and doesn\'t appear significant for xx Network use cases. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNym has some advantages, but they\'re behind in terms of development - fully permissioned chain, no PQC and with legal challenges ahead of them.\\n\\nVPNs are cool, but it\'s also just bulk traffic - porn, Torrents and crap of that nature. Not that we don\'t need that too, but it\'s a saturated and legally sensitive market (copyright violations, illegal content, etc). Due to the high cost of comparatively enormous bandwidth required for VPNs, it will be a very tough use case to monetize.

I\'ve no idea what will happen and I don\'t recommend anything.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nxx Network has been around for years and has users, but not very many because:\\n\\n- many Web3 and coin projects suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome ([example](http://localhost:3000/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not))\\n- many projects don\'t know about xx Network\\n- several smart projects know and appreciate xx Network but they\'re are still in the process of integrating with xx Network (or the other way around)\\n\\nWorldcoin is one of those smart projects in \\"the other way around\\" situation - xx Network is creating integrations for Worldcoin and this is work in progress (and progressing well).\\n\\nSpecifically, there are three Worldcoin Foundation grants that were awarded to xx Network-affiliated developers. You can read or listen about it in this interesting interview with [one of the developers](https://patcrypt.com/worldcoin-xx-network-collaboration-interview-with-mario-yaksetig/).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Worldcoin is doing their thing. Today I saw [this](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-mimos-partnership-bring-digital-proof-humanness-malaysia):\\n\\n> MIMOS Berhad, the applied research and development arm of the Malaysian Government, has signed an MoU with the Worldcoin Foundation, Tools for Humanity (TFH) and MyEG, a leading e-government services provider, to integrate Worldcoin technology into the country\u2019s digital infrastructure.\\n\\n> The intent of the MoU is to leverage the Worldcoin protocol and TFH technologies to improve ongoing and future work related to digital credentials. In doing so, it validates the importance of digital proof of humanness in the age of AI.\\n\\nHmm, wait, how many people live in Malaysia? 34 million. \\n\\nWhoa - xx coin will go to the moon!!! \\n\\nNo, it won\'t. But fine - let\'s talk about postage!\\n\\n## Postage\\n\\nI\'ve blogged about \\"postage\\", which is how xx Network plans to charge for its Premium tier suitable for power users. \\n\\nWhere will the collected postage go? Mostly to the validators - server operators on xx Network - and (if I recall correctly) part of it goes to the xx Foundation.\\n\\nDoes that mean that the price of xx coin will moon? Of course not.\\n\\nWe don\'t know if those Worldcoin apps in Malaysia will actually be released. It\'s just an MoU.\\n\\nEven if they make it, we don\'t know if they\'ll *choose* to use Worldcoin\'s privacy features that rely on xx Network. The Malaysian integrators *could* choose to not use them at all and I\'d say this may be the most likely outcome in this particular country.\\n\\nWe don\'t know how many apps will be developed, and how frequently they\'ll be used. \\n\\nWe also don\'t know if the apps will *need* access to Premium tier. Each individual user probably won\'t need it and postage measures access by each individual user. An app can have 5 million users and as long as each sends or receives several messages per minute, none of them will need to pay postage.\\n\\nAre the chances of Worldcoin apps using xx Network\'s Premium tier nil, then?\\n\\n## Why pay postage\\n\\nWhile only a very small percentage of Worldcoin (or other platform\'s) users will require access to Premium (or \\"unlimited\\" aka \\"best effort\\") tier, anyone who charges for their application or service or wants to prevent *another* paying user (or all the free users) from hogging them out, may want to ask users to subscribe to the Premium tier if it\'s affordable enough.\\n\\nI\'m not making this up to spread the idea that massive demand for xx coin is inevitable or just around the corner. \\n\\nWhat I\'m saying is I expect postage will be inexpensive enough to be purchased for \\"just in case\\" situations.\\n\\nWhen you think about it, that\'s almost the opposite from \\"xx coin will moon\\" - the idea here isn\'t to create scarcity and get rich off the appreciating xx coin. On the contrary!\\n\\nThe way markets work is: if you want more of something, you pay for it just enough to make the seller willing to satisfy that demand.\\n\\nIf xx Network\'s message mixing service (cMix) works well for you, there\'s no \\"reason\\" to pay anything. (But you have the option to donate to the Foundation if so inclined).\\n\\nBut the presence of a Free Tier also means that everyone gets the same rights. \\n\\nSomeone can stand up 500 containers in AWS and spam the network all day long just because. Or simply try to freeload as much as possible.\\n\\nIf this happens at scale, quality of service as experienced by Free tier users may be impacted.\\n\\nIf you are getting paid for the app you sell or rely on xx Network at scale, then it may be wise to avoid such congestions where a busy day for Free tier users translates into a busy day for your Support staff. It\'s better to pay some postage just in case of accidental or malicious congestions.\\n\\nAs users pay for Postage, decentralized nodes that participate on the network (\\"validators\\") earn more xx coins which means more nodes can come online without diluting any node\'s daily earnings and at the same time improves network throughput. \\n\\nDemand for xx coin may result in its price going up, but I would not expect significant impacts from demand for postage because as long as *similar* services exist, no one will pay 3x premium for xx Network. They may pay a 10% or even 110% more, but not for very long.\\n\\nIn addition to this \\"just in case I need it\\" scenario, there may be high volume users who prefer to use Premium tier on a regular basis.\\n\\nA power user who sends thousands of messages every day (example: IoT feed or remote camera that chunks images into many \\"text\\" messages) could set up multiple identities to stay within the Free tier limit, or make his life simpler and pay a small premium for 1-2 thousand messages above the cut-off message limit for the Premium tier.\\n\\nHow will postage work? You may view a draft of high-level design for v1.0 features [here](https://patcrypt.com/plans-for-postage-v1-announced/).\\n\\nAs you can see in that document, users will also be throttled per smaller units of time, so that no one can overload the network by exhausting their daily quota within 15 minutes. \\n\\nWe can also see that in v1.0 there will be no \\"reserved capacity\\" which some users would probably like to have. Examples:\\n\\n- Elections: with 5 million voters and (only) 3 hours to vote, you may want to prepay for 600 messages per second during voting hours on the election day. xx Network would then lower its Free tier throughput from (let\'s say) 7 to 5 messages per client per minute and drop total Free tier throughput per second by 600 messages per second. But this isn\'t easy. We may need smart contracts (to reserve time) which Polkadot SDK has, but xx Network hasn\'t yet activated on its Substrate-based xx chain. And there\'s another problem: speculators could front-run legitimate buyers as election dates are known in advance and often hard-coded in legislative acts\\n- Any user with \\"guaranteed minimum\\" requirements. Even if you need to send just 1 message per minute (which well within the Free tier - there\'s 1,440 minutes in a day) - you may want to pay postage in order to able to send at least one message per minute\\n\\nWhen you consider all these niche scenarios, it\'s easy to see how this gets complicated quickly. I\'ve no idea what\'s the best way to go about it in Postage v2 or later, but for thousands of users with custom requirements, Smart Contracts maybe the way to go as all mixing nodes can easily look them up on xx chain. \\n\\n## Node operators and permissionless postage\\n\\nIf you need guaranteed throughput for your clients, you can strike a deal whereby an operator gives you a dedicated, guaranteed fraction of their node\'s connections. You\'d have to approach them on xx Network Discord and so on, but in theory that\'s possible.\\n\\nNo one needs to know, you get guaranteed throughput when everyone else may be timing out while connecting to xx Network gateways. Can that be done?\\n\\nNot for very many messages and users, but it\'s certainly viable for either Free or Premium tiers. I can reserve 10kB/s for your client IP or throttle everyone else but your IP, for example.\\n\\nAny node operator could make such side deals on their own for users *who don\'t mind to always connect to the same gateways*. That decreases user\'s privacy, so that\'s a trade-off which may or may not matter.\\n\\nAnother trade-off is if the network is overloaded, that node may be able to accept your messages just fine, but still unable to complete mixing them with other (random) groups of nodes out there, so it\'s not guaranteed to work in terms of actually sending messages. \\n\\nI conclude this would be possible but not very valuable for either the node operators (\\"validators\\") or users. The Premium Tier is expected to be cheap enough to make these laborious workarounds unnecessary and unattractive financially, technically, and privacy-wise. \\n\\nOne use case for this may be local elections, where the government stands up 3-4 nodes and limits access to in-country IPs. As noted above that would impact - maybe even compromise (I\'m not qualified to tell) - privacy, but not the integrity of messages (protected by PQC), but it would also make DDoS attacks on that day much harder to execute - any in-country IP addresses could be shut down in minutes, while foreign IP addresses wouldn\'t be allowed to connect to those gateway nodes. I can\'t estimate the impact of this approach so I wouldn\'t recommend it, but there may be similar use cases where having your own node on the network could be beneficial.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nI don\'t expect Worldcoin\'s integrations in Malaysia will result in much demand on xx Network *when* postage becomes available. For Malaysia, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the government mandated that all Worldcoin-integrated apps include various gov-mandated data gathering add-ons.\\n\\nBut what excites me is that similar integrations will sooner or later happen in some other country. A Worldcoin-integrating app developer *may* also choose to enable xxNetwork-related privacy features. If that sounds unlikely to you, please see the interview with Mario and the voting integration (one of the three grants). Even Malaysia may want to enable anonymity in a Worldcoin voting app and disable it in other domestic Worldcoin applications.\\n\\nPostage v1.0 may not be able to satisfy all use cases right away. DoS-style attacks by sock-puppet accounts could cause issues even to users of the Premium tier, but xx Network has world-class developers who are no doubt aware of all these things and will make recommendations related to privacy, security, performance and reliability expectations.\\n\\nPostage v1.0 may become available a few months from now and it is one of the features essential for monetization of xx Network\'s mixing services.\\n\\nOther apps rely on donations, subscriptions, or may be VC-backed and don\'t need to charge just yet. \\n\\nxx Network is integrated with a blockchain service and very unique in that regard. Rewards - and later postage - are sent and received on a blockchain. For messaging, servers that pass and mix messages are operated by individuals from many countries and they\'re currently rewarded for their \\"mixing\\", but there\'s only a free tier so rewards aren\'t as impactful and demand for coins is lower because there aren\'t real life use cases for it. Postage will improve and better align users\' and operators\' incentives.\\n\\nMy take:\\n\\n- Worldcoin in Malaysia won\'t make xx coin \\"go to the moon\\"\\n- Benefits of xx Network integrations with Worldcoin are real. Potential for adoption is real. When the first integrated implementation happens xx Network traffic could see a significant increase\\n- All other apps that use xx Network as \\"transport\\" could use Premium tier, but currently Worldcoin seems to be the most significant integration. \\n- Postage won\'t make xx Network expensive to use. It will make xx Network deliver more value\\n- Until there\'s a way to *reserve* throughput, apps with high reliability expectations should have a way to fallback to Tor or direct access when uptime is more precious than privacy"},{"id":"2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-06-xx-network-updates-cryptographic-primitives.md","title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","description":"xx Network client replaces SIDH with CTIDH","date":"2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":15.915,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh","title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"xx Network client replaces SIDH with CTIDH","keywords":["xx network","pq","post-quantum","encryption","client","CTIDH","SIDH","ENS","postage","xx messenger","phoenixx","cmix"],"image":"/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Worldcoin and xx Network postage","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage"},"nextItem":{"title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat"}},"content":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\\n- [CTIDH](#ctidh)\\n- [Why xx Network developers picked the vulnerable SIDH](#why-xx-network-developers-picked-the-vulnerable-sidh)\\n- [But, *where* is this xx Messenger?](#but-where-is-this-xx-messenger)\\n- [Timelines and additional sources (some of disinformation)](#timelines-and-additional-sources-some-of-disinformation)\\n  - [Signal CEO](#signal-ceo)\\n  - [techlore.tech](#techloretech)\\n    - [Techlore discussion forum tip](#techlore-discussion-forum-tip)\\n- [xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good](#xx-chain-scam-signal-phone-numbers-good)\\n- [Take-aways](#take-aways)\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI\'m not a cryptography expert, so all I can do is rehash information from trusted sources (and you may verify it if you wish). \\n\\nWhat value does rehashing content that I myself can\'t verify add?

I didn\'t know that until today.\\n\\n> [xx Network client] switched to CTIDH after a [vulnerability](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1038) was found for SIDH. Users interested in PQ messaging should use this branch.\\n\\nSource: [this commit](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/docs/-/commit/46eb7f16d270d2616fe990cbcb5f485f0567e968)\\n\\nWhere can people find easy-to-digest information about CTIDH? Go [here](https://ctidh.isogeny.org/).\\n\\nWhat cryptographic primitives does xx Network client use? Current list from [the edited page](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/docs/-/commits/master/end_to_end.md) that still mentions SIDH s:\\n\\n- XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.\\n- Blake2b: Length is 256 bits. Used as part of key generation, key expansion, identity generation, and identification codes. Used to combine Diffie\u2013Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.\\n- HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.\\n- Diffie\u2013Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.\\n\\nNote that the page still mentions SIDH for PQ and below that is a note that it was replaced by CTIDH is below it. This is so that if you have a client with an older build, you know that you should use a newer client if you care about latest PQ encryption.\\n\\n## Why xx Network developers picked the vulnerable SIDH\\n\\nThey didn\'t.\\n\\nxx Network picked SIDH at the time it was *not* known to be vulnerable and they did it because it was evaluated and found to be suitable. \\n\\nOne reason particularly stands out to me because it alone - given that SIDH used to be recommended by experts in the field - made it very desirable for use in PQ private messaging.\\n\\n> the primary reason is the key sizes as they fit into a single packet\\n\\nSource: [xx Network forum](https://forum.xx.network/t/paper-an-efficient-key-recovery-attack-on-sidh-preliminary-version-affects-xx-messenger-quantum-security/6835/3)\\n\\nAs you can see the SIDH vulnerability paper was published *after* xx Messenger was released.\\n\\nYou can read that entire thread for additional information and context, including this part:\\n\\n> This has **no impact on the privacy of cMix**.\\n\\n## But, *where* is this xx Messenger?\\n\\nIt came out early and it used xx Network in a way that\'s not efficient by current xx Network standards (now the recommended way is [xxDK](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/xxdk-wasm)).\\n\\nAs direction of development changed towards a less generic, more Web3-oriented applications, xx Messenger wasn\'t updated, but it was still considered not at risk and it wasn\'t promoted either. It would have needed total overhaul (front-end for Web3, back-end for xxDK) and while the source code is still available, the application itself was pulled (or allowed to expire, I\'m not sure) on iOS. I haven\'t checked for Android.\\n\\n[Phoenixx.io](https://phoenixx.io) has been developing a modern mobile-compatible client for cMix network. It\'s supposed to come out in H2 of 2024 and a beta desktop version has been available for a while.\\n\\n## Timelines and additional sources (some of disinformation)\\n\\nAgain, for discoverability and curation, I want to share a few more links. \\n\\n### Signal CEO\\n\\nSignal was the first PQ messenger. That\'s according to Signal, as you can see in this [piece of fake news](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1761279358319366506) by the Signal CEO:\\n\\n![Signal CEO says theirs is the first PQ messaging application](/img/blog/2024-06-06-signal-first-pq-fake-news.png)\\n\\n- Source: [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/signal-adds-quantum-resistant-encryption-to-its-e2ee-messaging-protocol/)\\n\\n- Fact: xx Messenger came out [in late January 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220125171829/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220125005773/en/Private-Messaging-App-Launches-on-Quantum-Resistant-Decentralized-xx-network)\\n- Fact: SIDH key recovery attack paper received by publisher [on July 30, 2022](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975)\\n\\n> January 25, 2022 10:30 AM Eastern Standard Time\\n> LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The world\u2019s first quantum-resistant messaging app, xx messenger, launched on the xx network today.\\n\\nThe above is just FYI - don\'t mention this to any open-minded people like those who run Techlore.tech. \\n\\n### techlore.tech\\n\\nI\'ve said at the top that I can\'t post a simple comment on CTIDH update where I\'d like to. I meant I\'d like to visit techlore.tech and share an update.\\n\\nI\'ll use this post to say a few words about that community of independent thinkers. \\n\\nLast February I head over there, register and, in a topic related to Wickr alternatives, mention **two** applications that use xx Network\'s cMix (not just xx Messenger):\\n\\n- Speakeasy/Haven - as a modern (xxDK mentioned above) version but not yet for mobile\\n- xx Messenger - as a mobile app that (at the time) was still available on iOS\\n\\nSince I\'m following xx Network closely, I *know* that xx Messenger isn\'t maintained, I know *why* (for the reasons explained above), so I mention that Phoenixx.io plans to launch a modern mobile messenger and that Speakeasy may also become available for mobile.\\n\\nBut, in one comment I make a mistake and cite that false statement by the Signal CEO and also say that Signal *has* metadata that has been disclosed to law enforcement and assist in identifying users (not the content of Signal messages). A minor mistake - which I admitted and rephrased - was that I said that Signal had in the past disclosed users\' IP addresses, but of course they wouldn\'t do that as law enforcement comes to them asking about the use of Signal (they likely already have users\' IP address). I stick to the statement that metadata had been disclosed and that IP addresses *could* be as well.\\n\\nMembers and the owner respond with dismissive comments, insults, accusations and foul language.\\n\\nGuy nicknamed TechFounder [goes first](https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=site%3adiscuss.techlore.tech+%22xx+network%22&d=4678435270362092&mkt=en-WW&setlang=en-US&w=CQQ_JiUp0zhPgYEILFIgyomLftTED_lL):\\n\\n> Where\u2019s their Post-Quantum encryption documentation? Has it been auditied (sic!)/proven it actually protects against those attacks?\\n\\nGee, indeed, where could it be possibly found? Maybe by searching the Internet for \'xx Network\' or \'xx Messenger\'? \\n\\n> You didn\u2019t provide anything useful for anyone, just for your ego saying that your obscure messenger it\u2019s better than Signal when it clearly isn\u2019t.\\n\\nI suspect that\'s what triggered them: I pointed out that the big news about Signal being the first with PQ was really a piece of fake news since xx Messenger (and possibly other) PQ messengers have been out there for a while. I did *not* claim xx Messenger was better at all. \\n\\nShe didn\'t say Signal was the first *major* PQ messenger and it wasn\'t on X/Twitter - her statement was posted on Mastodon - so she wasn\'t limited by the maximum number of characters per post so that she couldn\'t qualify her statement. To me, that\'s a problem and simply pointing that out ought to be useful to the community because it says something about the person who runs that shop. Not that she\'s compromised or anything that bad, but if you can\'t trust 100% of what a person says, it may be the time to start scrutinizing every word that comes out of their mouth.\\n\\nOne may say it\'s an innocent mistake despite not being limited by word count on X - one word less or more, what\'s the big deal? She\'s not a semi-literate, misspelling computer geek familiar with only computer languages. She [knows better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker#Early_life_and_education).\\n\\n> Whittaker completed her bachelor\'s **degree in rhetoric** at University of California, Berkeley\\n\\nOr maybe she was indeed precise and accurately stated that Signal was the first to add PQ encryption to Signal. xx Network was the first to add it to xx Messenger. Everyone is right!!!\\n\\nAnd what about TechFounder\'s obscurity comment? Of course, what can possibly be more obscure to people actively engaged in cryptography and privacy than work of Dr. Chaum?\\n\\nBut not everyone at Techlore.tech is incompetent and dismissive. Another user - Karner - obviously performed due diligence. Their expert opinion:\\n\\n> You\u2019re referring to an obscure blockchain-based scam-based messaging platform that has no users and uses a broken cryptosystem (SIDH)\u2026\\n\\nAll right, I\'m promoting scams which I guess makes me a scammer (or a useful idiot at best). That\'s a promising line of attack against my claim that xx Messenger was PQ before Signal!\\n\\nNever mind that I didn\'t even mention xx coin. But now that I am blogging on my personal blog everyone can check my X posts (tweets) and blog posts here and easily find dozens of occurrences where I encouraged and invited people to \\"invest\\" in xx coin and all the claims it\'s going to moon. Good luck with that!\\n\\nAlso never mind that although SIDH - one of the pieces in that stack - was found to be vulnerable, xx developers estimated cMix was still fine.\\n\\nThen [ThiccRaiden](https://discuss./t/wickr-messaging-is-no-longer-available-as-of-31-12-2023/6576) (claims to accept any pronouns in his/her/their profile - must be very nice, I thought) says to me:\\n\\n> You join the forum, literally make shit up and then backpedal to \u2018well it\u2019s hypothetically possible,\u2019 while promoting a random messaging app\\n\\n(The stuff I \\"made up\\" was the IP misstatement mentioned earlier, which I rephrased and which didn\'t impact the validity of my claim about Signal\'s access to that metadata - they may not *retain* it, but they do have it, as does AWS.)\\n\\nI respond to ThiccRaiden\'s rude message by saying that I don\'t care about the rudeness, but I won\'t respond in kind and if the site owner moderates, they should apply the same rules to all members.\\n\\nBy now I\'ve been called a scammer, poster of useless information (spammer?), and liar. What a hearty, warm welcome!\\n\\nThe site owner completely ignores all that and doubles down on ThiccRaiden\'s message of ignorance and FUD:\\n\\n> the Android App hasn\u2019t been updated since August of 2022. Not touching this with a 50ft pole. \\n\\nLet\'s unpack that:\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is obscure**. False. It wasn\'t a Tier 1 - let\'s say it wasn\'t even Tier 2 - messaging application, but that doesn\'t matter. It was very likely the first PQ messenger, by early 2024 it was out there with PQ for years before other \\"alternatives to Wickr\\", cMix that it uses was created by some of the top people in the field and we know it wasn\'t obscure because the app had many downloads. Not only are/were there cMix messaging apps in ongoing development, but application interfaces are being implemented for \\"application messages\\" from other projects as well.\\n\\n- **Saying that Signal has users\' identifiable metadata is \\"making shit up\\"**. Is that true? Yes. Signal operates Signal gateways. We know they have at least some MD on (date of user\'s last use).\\n\\nSome may have seen this slide which says that Signal can provide \\"last date of a user\'s connectivity to the service\\". \\n\\n![Signal and user metadata](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata.png)\\n\\n- **Saying that it\'s hypothetically possible is back-pedalling**. It\'s not just \\"hypothetically\\" possible, it\'s simply \\"pending a search warrant\\". It\'s not even Signal that owns Signal gateway nodes - it\'s the freaking AWS!\\n\\nIf law enforcement delivers a search warrant to Signal, Signal gives what they have and law enforcement finds you used Signal yesterday. Then they also find that among 15 suspected friends of yours only one has also used Signal yesterday - how hard is it to guess which of the 15 may be the guy you used Signal to communicate with? \\n\\nIf Signal retains only \\"date\\" (no hour, no second), could AWS be asked to provide their firewall logs to help LE narrow that down a bit? Yes, but only theoretically, so don\'t worry about it!\\n\\nOh, no, they in fact do provide more than just a \\"date\\". Oops! \\n\\n![Signal metadata in response to search warrant](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-response-to-search-warrant.png)\\n\\nMillisecond precision. That\'s [from here](https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/).\\n\\nHow about this scenario:\\n\\n- LE asks Signal for a timestamp and gets it with millisecond precision\\n- LE asks AWS to give list of IPs accessing Signal gateways through AWS firewall during a 200 millisecond interval surrounding the timestamp provided by Signal\\n\\nIs that only theoretical? How many IP addresses would AWS return? 50? How many from a small country? I\'d say just one.\\n\\n- **xx Messenger hasn\'t been touched in a year**. I know that, I know why, and that\'s why in my original message I said that and also gave links for Speakeasy/Haven and the Phoenixx app (at the time called Echoexx and available for alpha testing). But why not ignore all that and make a completely biased and ignorant comment (not that I care, but they purportedly do, being big on education and stuff).\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is vulnerable** (I don\'t have the exact wording). When I mentioned xx Network\'s PQ encryption, they laser-focused on trashing xx Network because of SIDH and completely ignored that I showed that the Signal CEO in fact lied when she said they came up with PQ first, and that SIDH was not vulnerable when xx Messenger adopted it. Now that SIDH has been replaced CTIDH, I wanted to reflect on that thread.\\n\\n- **xx Messenger is a scam**. This is hilarious. xx Messenger wasn\'t a blockchain-based app, it couldn\'t connect to any blockchain whatsoever, and even to this day xx Network\'s cMix is free for use. You don\'t need any coins, I even [blogged about that here](/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important). But there\'s also a subtler, Signal-related point that I want to make at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nSome of their comments are still online:\\n\\n![Warm welcome by ThiccRaiden](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-abuse-01.png)\\n\\nNice people, right? Well, [they say this about themselves](https://www.techlore.tech/about):\\n\\n> We\'re a small team educating people \\n\\nWhen you see \\"don\'t make shit up\\" in response to your civil and on-point comment, you know you\'re being educated!\\n\\nIt\'s a trap!\\n\\n![Warm welcome by Karner](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-abuse-02.png)\\n\\nThis is the owner\'s comment that followed (in which he didn\'t even comment on what I said about the unnecessarily abusive language in several earlier comments):\\n\\n![Warm welcome by Henry Fischer](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-admin-01.png)\\n\\nHis vision (also from the About page):\\n\\n> We envision a world where technology works for us, not against us\u2014and we want to prove to people they can make a real impact for themselves and others\\n\\nThat\'s very funny because I just recalled that, *after* the abuse that followed my comment on xx Network applications as possible alternatives to Wickr, I spent three hours creating (in the appropriate section) a post with xx Network resources, and answering questions from members who were interested in it. Making an impact, contributing, discussing with other knowledge-thirsty individuals, helping your fellow men better themselves - that\'s what it\'s all about, right?\\n\\nAnd where\'s that topic? \\n\\nOh, it\'s nowhere! \\n\\nThey simply deleted my account, responses from the Wickr thread and all the content I\'d created (even from the other generic topic), so it\'s all gone now. They also wiped my xx Network topic from archive.org. \\"We care a lot!\\"\\n\\nSince only the quoted parts of my messages survive and they deleted all my responses while leaving their own comments and attacks online, I think it\'s perfectly appropriate to post about my Techlore experience here where they can\'t censor and delete me.\\n\\n#### Techlore discussion forum tip\\n\\nOnly ever make positive comments about Signal and don\'t double-down on them if you want to last.\\n\\nThat\'s my \\"lesson learned\\" from the short and miserable experience I had on that site.\\n\\nI just checked on archive.org and found that penguin_terminal echoed my thoughts in [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205214557/https://discuss.techlore.tech/t/signal-usernames-are-finally-coming/6069) comment made in 2023:\\n\\n![penguin_terminal on Singal metadata](/img/blog/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-by-penguin_terminal.png)\\n\\nI didn\'t think of this part:\\n\\n> your ISP reports you to the authorizes when logs show you accessing servers used by Signal.\\n\\nOnce your friendly government offices gets the \\"date\\" from Signal, they can ask the local telco or ISP for the hour, time and millisecond. Not that Signal already doesn\'t give that, but getting it locally is easier and they can get your phone number or fixed line subscription details in the same go. Nice!\\n\\nLike me, he got \\"corrected\\" another Signal fan, Tech-Tropper:\\n\\n> This is absolutely theoretical and wrong.\\n\\nEh? Why? Here\'s why Session sucks (according to Tech-Tropper):\\n\\n> Besides, Session does not have PERFECT SECRECY. Just take your recovery code and login in with another device. You will see the messages sent in the last week.\\n\\nIt\'s simple - they \\"just take your recovery code\\". Scientists estimate that 94% of Session users have their recovery code on a yellow Post-it note on the side of their refrigerator.\\n\\nOne last thing about that Wickr thread and techlore.tech I want to say is about that \\"not touching this with a 50ft pole\\" by the site owner. Does this make any sense to you:\\n\\n- The guy kept using Signal without PQ encryption (simply because Signal **did not have any**) for years. He presumably still uses it, despite Signal having his phone number, responds to warrants, while both Signal and AWS have access to his metadata\\n- But xx Messenger is a disaster because SIDH was found to be vulnerable. Never mind that there\'s no evidence that the app was exploited or even exploitable.\\n\\nI don\'t know what\'s wrong with people on that site and I won\'t speculate about it. \\n\\nI\'m just happy that they deleted my account before I wasted too much time there.\\n\\n## xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good\\n\\nI want to elaborate on that scam accusation and the parallels with Signal, as I said I\'d do at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nOn Techlore forums they justify Signal\'s \\"need\\" for phone numbers as the only way to prevent spam. \\n\\nUgh, okay, but that\'s a \\"in order to save the village, we had to destroy it\\" kind of measure for a *privacy*-related application!\\n\\nxx Network is still [completely free and will introduce API limiting only for power users and only when postage becomes available](/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important), you don\'t need a phone number *and* you can use a network-native, decentralized identity. This has worked this way since 2022. Phoenixx also implements ENS-related identity (ENS). \\n\\nxx Network is open to spam, that\'s true. If it was spammed, postage would probably be implemented sooner. But if you don\'t know a person\'s xx Network identity (which you can\'t unless they give it to you), there\'s no way to spam them in the first place so spam is still not a problem. \\n\\nIf you now consider just the privacy aspect here: which of these is a bigger honeypot and potential (privacy) scam here? \\n\\nOne app has your phone number and some metadata. \\n\\nThe other doesn\'t know anything about you, its gateways are decentralized in dozens of jurisdictions, there\'s nowhere to \\"register\\" your data and there\'s no plan for the average user to ever needing to pay anything.\\n\\nI don\'t think either of the platforms is a \\"scam\\", but it\'s easy to see which one is designed for privacy and why having a coin users don\'t ever have to buy beats collecting phone numbers.\\n\\nOne of them is a major honeypot, that\'s for sure.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\n- xx Network client now uses CTIDH\\n- Don\'t believe everything you read on Techlore"},{"id":"2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-17-speakeasy-haven-anonymous-event-chat.md","title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","description":"Simple PoC that shows how xx Network chat can be used in your application or on your Web site","date":"2024-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"apps","permalink":"/blog/tags/apps"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat","title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","apps"],"description":"Simple PoC that shows how xx Network chat can be used in your application or on your Web site","keywords":["speakeasy","haven","chat"],"image":"/img/blog/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Network client uses CTIDH PQ algo now","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh"},"nextItem":{"title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not"}},"content":"- [How to include xx Network chat in your application](#how-to-include-xx-network-chat-in-your-application)\\n- [What works and what doesn\'t](#what-works-and-what-doesnt)\\n- [Try it on Codepen](#try-it-on-codepen)\\n- [Take-aways](#take-aways)\\n\\n## How to include xx Network chat in your application\\n\\nThis is a very simple test or \\"proof of concept\\", if you will, for the inclusion of xx Network chat in Web applications.\\n\\nTo minimize the amount of work required, I used `iframe`s:\\n\\n- The top frame shows a Web-based ImpressJS presentation\\n- The bottom frame shows xx Network Haven (formerly Speakeasy) app - event organizer is showing his view of a channel while using the community instance at https://haven.xx.network.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations.png)\\n\\nThe chat participants don\'t login to Haven in this Web browser. \\n\\nThe bottom frame only shows chat from event participants, but both the top and bottom frame are just for viewing of organizer\'s content. \\n\\nAny chat comment would be entered by each chat participant in their own xx Haven session (maybe another browser altogether).\\n\\nCan guests comment and how?\\n\\nThe event organizer *may* share the invitation link and password in order to allow participants to comment from own Haven instance (accessed in the participant\'s browser), but that is optional.\\n\\nWe have several possible scenarios. For example:\\n\\n- Only the event owner can chat (answer voice questions, share links...)\\n- Event owner and event guests (panelists, for example) chat, while guests can only view their comments in that `iframe` above\\n- If event guests are provided with the channel invite, they can login to xx Haven (own or public instance) and chat (ask questions, comment, etc.) as well\\n\\n## What works and what doesn\'t\\n\\nThis is a very basic, no-code PoC, so it\'s not surprising that it\'s not usable in this form. \\n\\nProduction-worthy setup would require some customization of at least xx Haven CSS, if not the application itself.\\n\\nBut even so, we can appreciate and highlight some advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- No email or other identity needs to be shared with the organizer, but panelists or viewers *may* choose to identify themselves by providing a signed proof of external identity\\n- Guests/panelists and possibly viewers receive the link - maybe it\'s shared in the presentation, maybe in another xx Haven channel - but links are not personalized and we can\'t know who is the author of each comment\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- Events open to public comments may be abused by spammers. Although individual accounts can be blocked by channel admin, automated spam attacks would be laborious to deal with so fully open events may be hard to manage\\n- Layout: obviously the xx Haven frame doesn\'t use space economically. We\'d have to create an instance that only exposes the chat itself, and possibly put that \\"chat box\\" in a narrow, vertical frame to the right\\n\\nxx Network currently retains messages for three weeks which may be both good and bad depending on use case.\\n\\n## Try it on Codepen\\n\\nYou can try this on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/).\\n\\nFirst, switch the layout to have the code (HTML, CSS, JS) panes on the right hand side.\\n\\nThen paste this code to HTML pane and wait for the sites to load.\\n\\n```html\\n<html>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n<iframe src=\\"https://impress.js.org/#/bored\\" width=\\"1400\\" height=\\"400\\">\\n  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\\n</iframe>\\n    </div>\\n    <div>\\n  <iframe src=\\"https://haven.xx.network\\" width=\\"1400\\" height=\\"500\\">\\n  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\\n</iframe>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nThis screenshot shows a non-default layout (code on the right) with the iframes loaded/loading.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-17-02-iframe-in-codepen.png)\\n\\nIt may be tricky to login to xx Haven here, but it\'s easy to figure out once you realize you can scroll both left-right and up-down within the bottom frame.\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nWhile this \\"integration\\" isn\'t even an integration - it\'s just two `iframe`s - I think it does show the opportunity for using xx Network for events in which the identity of each chat participant can remain hidden and any comments cannot be linked to them even by the event organizer.\\n\\nThis runs contrary to the approach taken by most marketing-focused events - in the sense that participants\' privacy *decreases* engagement and tracking - but for events where privacy of the commenter is important, there\'s no way to link a participant\'s IP address with comments.\\n\\nA participant\'s IP address could be hidden by accessing the Web event address over Tor, but comments may be entered directly in participant\'s own instance of xx Haven which can even be running locally (e.g. in container). \\n\\nFurthermore, xx Haven provides unique, reusable identities (bossCompartmentalisedDisownment in the first screenshot), so each network identity can be reused without disclosing the participant\'s IP address and/or true identity. This may be useful in situations where a participant wishes to be recognized - for example, a designated identity may be reused across events to provide support or engage in 1-on-1 chat with participants for follow up."},{"id":"2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-08-securedrop-vs-speakeasy-haven-and-tor-secretservice.md","title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","description":"SecureDrop tries to reinvent the wheel instead of integrating decentralized messengers","date":"2024-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"tor","permalink":"/blog/tags/tor"}],"readingTime":7.495,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not","title":"SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","tor"],"description":"SecureDrop tries to reinvent the wheel instead of integrating decentralized messengers","keywords":["speakeasy","haven","xx network","securedrop"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xx Network as private event chat in online Web events","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat"},"nextItem":{"title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view"}},"content":"[I\'ve said it already](https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1589835968911413249) so I\'ll just rephrase: it takes three PhDs to use SecureDrop - one admin, one journalist and one user.\\n\\nBut you don\'t know what you don\'t know, so instead of fixing the complicated mess that (current) SecureDrop is - which could be done by including **any** viable open source decentralized messenger into their packaged solution - they\'re coming up with [a new protocol](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol) of their own. Of course.\\n\\nWhat does it do?\\n\\n> What is implemented here is a small-scale, self-contained, anonymous message box, where anonymous parties (sources) can contact and receive replies from trusted parties (journalists). \\n\\nWhere\'s the server?\\n\\n> Server: For this project, a server might be a physical dedicated server housed in a trusted location, a physical server in an untrusted location, or a virtual server in a trusted or untrusted context. Besides the initial setup, all the connections to the server have to happen though the Tor Hidden Service Protocol. \\n\\nFine, I\'ll just set up my own Hidden Service.\\n\\nBut, does Source need a PhD? \\n\\n> Source(s): No on-device persistence shall be required for a source to interact with the system; they should be able to conduct all communications using only a single, theoretically-memorizable passphrase. The source uses Tor Browser to preserve their anonymity.\\n\\nJust using Tor Browser properly is very hard. Haven users don\'t need to use Tor, but they may if they wish. Because with Haven, Tor is optional so it\'s much harder to use Tor incorrectly if either party does choose to use it for secure direct messaging.\\n\\nI\'d even say that modern messaging apps like xx Network\'s Haven almost *cannot* be used incorrectly. Choose a strong password and don\'t have a spyware infested browser or OS. That\'s basically it.\\n\\nBut this is SecureDrop, so here we go again... Start by subscribing to Udemy\'s \\"Python from Zero to Hero\\"...\\n\\n```sh\\n# python3 source.py -h\\nusage: source.py [-h] [-p PASSPHRASE] -a {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete} [-i ID] [-m MESSAGE] [-f FILES [FILES ...]]\\n\\noptions:\\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\\n  -p PASSPHRASE, --passphrase PASSPHRASE\\n                        Source passphrase if returning\\n  -a {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete}, --action {fetch,read,reply,submit,delete}\\n                        Action to perform\\n  -i ID, --id ID        Message id\\n  -m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE\\n                        Plaintext message content for submissions or replies\\n  -f FILES [FILES ...], --files FILES [FILES ...]\\n                        List of local files to submit\\n```\\n\\n## How it could be done\\n\\n### Pull method\\n\\nIn this approach Source shares files over a Tor Hidden Service and informs a Journalist to download the file.\\n\\nThis doesn\'t require *any* development. \\n\\n- Journalist publishes their Haven nick (e.g. MrTriggerHappyJourno) \\n- Source runs owns [Haven container](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container) or accesses other party\'s (e.g. public) Haven instance to create their own identity (DrDeepThroat)\\n- Source initiates chat with Journalist using Haven by contacting them directly and inviting them to personal chat channel with DrDeepThroat and MrTriggerHappyJourno as the only participants\\n- If the Source decides to share their files, they start Onion container with Hidden (Web) Service and share the link to the Journalist in Haven private chat\\n\\nI provide a walk-through and sample configuration files below.\\n\\n### Push method\\n\\nThis approach follows SecureDrop\'s approach where the \\"file upload\\" site is operated by Journalist. That seems like a very risky idea to me - Sources would better off uploading files to one of decentralized S3 services - but that\'s how SecureDrop does it.\\n\\nIn this approach they would still use a decentralized secure messenger (Haven from xx Network or some other) and the same Web server app Secure Drop already has.\\n\\n## Walk-through for Pull method\\n\\nI think it\'s easier to use Haven and Pull method than SecureDrop (Push method) and I\'ll show you why.\\n\\nWith Docker installed, the Source downloads this repository from Tor Browser or over SOCKS5 proxy (using git cli) and starts all the services they\'ll need. \\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container\\ncd xx-haven-container/tor\\ndocker compose up\\n```\\n\\nHaven is now running on localhost (temporary VM) and Caddy provides HTTPS proxy at https://localhost:443 to Source. This takes care of secure messaging and metadata shredding. \\n\\nIf you want to know more, see [this guide](/docs/haven-user-guide/get-started) or fire up your own instance.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-00-xx-network-haven-localhost-service.png)\\n\\nThis list below shows all services in this Docker Compose. \\n\\nThe configuration files can be in line with best practices and thereby require **zero configuration** by either Source (they use Haven and Web server) or Journalist (they use own instance of Haven).\\n\\n- Caddy - HTTPS proxy for Haven\\n- NGINX - Web server that runs my Tor Hidden (Web) Service\\n- Haven - local (personal) instance of Haven (to create Haven identity and chat with Journalist)\\n- Alpine/Tor - Tor server that exposes Hidden (Web) Service at a `.onion` address\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker ps -a\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE\\n52b873713f26   caddy                        \\n324711b42905   nginx:latest  \\n5e3054ec8d21   ghcr.io/armchairancap/haven:latest\\n023a0df1a5ed   alpine:latest \\n```\\n\\nTor is running in Alpine and the Source can get our Hidden Service address from Container ID for `alpine:latest` like so:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker exec -it 023a0df1a5ed cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname\\n6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion\\n# alternatively\\n$ sudo cat tor-service/hostname\\n```\\n\\nThe `hostname` file is in the `tor-service` directory (relative to repo clone location: `./xx-haven-container/tor/tor-service/`).\\n\\nThat\'s all it takes to visit the service on Tor - use Tor Browser to access that link.\\n\\nBut, what is our NGINX service sharing/serving? \\n\\nThe two test files I put in the `tor-docs` subdirectory in the place where I run `docker compose up`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo ls  ./tor-docs/\\nfile.txt  index.html\\n```\\n\\nActually, `index.html` isn\'t even necessary - it\'s there to make this demo simpler - by being able to view index.html which links to file.txt.\\n\\nIn any case, our Source shares 6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion with his Journalist and that\'s it.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-01-hidden-web-service.png)\\n\\nThe Journalist downloads the file over Tor and the Source can see that in Tor logs (in Docker Compose console).\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2024-05-08-02-get-files-from-hidden-web-service.png)\\n\\nAfter the Journalist confirms they got the file in Haven chat channel, the Source uses CTRL+C to stop Docker service and removes everything (the entire ./xx-haven-container/ directory or - even better - the entire temporary VM if they had one). \\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nDon\'t perform this step if you want to reuse your Onion address or Docker Compose example. (Of course, you may, and create another set of Tor and Haven identities next time you use this stack.)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n```sh\\n# press CTRL-C to stop docker-compose\\n# sudo rm -rf ./tor-*\\n```\\n\\nWith Tor identity removed, next time the Sources wishes to use the same stack they have a new Onion address while Haven identity could be restored if they backed it up (by exporting it from Haven Web UI to JSON file) and stored in a secure location.\\n\\nBack to those file names: our Source could share a direct link to the file (6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion/file.txt) and file.txt could be encrypted if you wanted the extra security - the Source may share that password with the Journalist in their private Haven chat channel.\\n\\nThe password could be shared with the Journalist in Haven, but if the file is randomly named there\'s no risk of anyone guessing this file name on a Hidden Service address with directory listing disabled (it is disabled by default on NGINX).\\n\\nTo take that approach, remove index.html and move the content file to a random name:\\n\\n```sh\\n# use CTRL+C to stop docker compose\\n$ openssl rand -hex 50\\ncd7457899fcd7ea28f09b8fd7eec090f9207634501ee910c3a58b3b7bb35e68e8ec17b05a7e1626059a089cd7318ec69589a\\n$ sudo rm ./tor-docs/index.html\\n$ sudo mv ./tor-docs/file.txt ./tor-docs/cd7457899fcd7ea28f09b8fd7eec090f9207634501ee910c3a58b3b7bb35e68e8ec17b05a7e1626059a089cd7318ec69589a\\n$ docker compose start\\n```\\n\\nAll that\'s necessary here is to put your content in ./tor-docs/. There\'s no configuration of any kind.

Centralized or decentralized doesn\'t matter - as long as there\'s a person that can be sued, they\'re good to go after them. (In the case of the US government they don\'t even care if you\'re a US citizen or resident.)\\n\\nMaybe some used to think - apparently, some on X still do to this day - that one can just ignore the delistings of their coins from CEX or the draconian anti-privacy and anti-liberty laws taking effect in EU and elsewhere. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that\'s not possible as long as we have these quasi-capitalist and socialist governments unite in their fascist and globalist mission to eliminate freedom.\\n\\nIt\'s not hard to imagine what comes next - it\'s not unlike what I said in the post [EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position](/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users). In fact, it\'s the same thing, in my opinion. \\n\\nHere\'s how I see this will play out for DEXes:\\n\\n- Prominent US-based DEX developers, non-profits, community members, server operators are silenced \\n- Many users drop off as well\\n- The same thing happens worldwide\\n- \\"Anonymous\\" (in their opinion) community members continue development and operations (decentralized Git, hidden services on Tor, etc.), but volumes are small and liquidity sucks\\n- Because anonymity and reputation don\'t mix well, scams increase (malicious commits, for example), fundraising becomes hard, and their user base a tiny fraction of what it used to be\\n\\nDecentralized Exchanges won\'t disappear, but they\'re in for a very difficult period. \\n\\nAnother possibility - not immediate, but 3-5 years from now - is that the West sets up some version of the commie firewall that detects and blocks IP addresses of known DEX nodes. I *know* that\'s very difficult to do well, but so is today\'s blocking of general Internet in certain hellholes around world which does work very well. All it takes is a bit of disruption and a globally disruptive legal action which all major governments and globalist organizations seem to be eager to team up on.\\n\\n## Impact on cryptocurrencies\\n\\nIt\'s easy to think this could mainly impact \\"illegal\\" (privacy) coins. That was my first thought, at least.\\n\\nBut that is not the case. It will impact *all DEX users*, *all DEX exchanges* and therefore *all coins*. \\n\\nIn the case of major crypto-currencies, any coin that other coins are denominated in - primarily stablecoins, but also BTC, ETH and others.\\n\\nWho knows, maybe - in I\'m right - privacy coins could regain some of the lost popularity among the leftover DeFi hardliners, but if you lose 90% of users and gain 20%, that\'s still not a great result and you\'re not growing or \\"changing the world\\" (sorry, that\'s as naive as I am willing to go - I won\'t say \\"democratizing finance\\").\\n\\nI\'ve just looked at the past 12 months of Ethereum vs. Monero on Google Trends. I assume the Google globalists aren\'t feeding us fake trends, although we can\'t exclude that possibility.\\n\\nIf you remove Ethereum from the chart and look at Monero alone, you\'ll see it went up a lot in late 2023 and then dropped off. I think it will drop even further (see that post on EU above). \\n\\n![Google Trends - Ethereum vs Monero](/img/blog/2024-04-11-interest-over-time-ethereum-vs-monero-1y.png)\\n\\nBut when Ethereum is added to the chart, Monero looks flat and barely registers.\\n\\nIt\'s not an apples-to-apples comparison, I know, but it shows two things:\\n\\n- The average user cares about flipping coins, not about privacy (not something I like to see, but let\'s admit it)\\n- Despite the ongoing attack on privacy (and other) crypto-currencies in the EU, Monero is attracting just a small fraction of crypto-currency users, which I think confirms my expectation that most crypto-exchange users will give up or trade \\"legal and regulated coins\\" (completely useless circle-jerk as far as I\'m concerned - it\'s no different from flipping FANGs all day long)\\n\\n## What can be done\\n\\nMaybe some \\"benevolent dictator\\" like that Bukele guy (not benevolent in my opinion, but I\'m trying to think like the average teenage Bitcoin fan on X) permits DEX in their country and some prominent developers give up citizenship and relocate there, but this can\'t do anything for the users in countries where the use of decentralized exchanges is illegal.\\n\\nWould economic and political gains from such policies be net-positive? Probably not. Maybe that\'d earn sanctions, cut them off from the IMF/WB, etc. I\'m not suggesting utilitarianism, but merely the fact that politicians have to consider it as there would be a price to pay.\\n\\nAssuming some jurisdictions decide to harbor such activities, the next problem to consider is DEX users\' privacy.\\n\\nI wouldn\'t even attempt to suggest xx Network mixnet (cMixx) could be used to circumvent the problem. This solution already exists and works (see [Proxxy](https://github.com/xx-labs/proxxy/)) and we\'ll probably see it as an extension or \\"Web 3 app\\" in browsers like [Carbon](https://carbon.website/) one day.\\n\\nHow many users will dare to violate laws this way? I\'d say a small minority - primarily those from countries with governments \\"who haven\'t gotten their shit together\\" (yet).\\n\\nTor Browser may be another option, although it\'s not as good a solution as cMixx. It\'s harder to use correctly, and setting up malicious Tor nodes costs next to nothing. In fact it does cost nothing if you\'re a government and fund that activity with freshly printed money or new public debt.\\n\\n## What xx Network has to offer\\n\\nxx Network\'s Proxxy approach acts as a mixing proxy gateway between your client (for example, Carbon browser) and the server (for example, DEX server nodes). This is useful because it breaks the link between DEX activity (observable by all) and user\'s IP and location.\\n\\nIt also hides the connection between a wallet (addresses) and the owner. For non-private coins, a DEX observer would see there\'s a wallet with 123 XYZ coins, and monitor ins and outs, but they couldn\'t see who owns it. If one were to trade on a DEX via Proxxy, they could do that in privacy and exit to a privacy coin (so that the last leg is also anonymized on-chain).\\n\\nBut let\'s not forget that a DEX could route all its messages over xx Network\'s cMix protocol. [xx Network dashboard](https://dashboard.xx.network/) currently shows 3000 messages per second. That could be enough for a DEX that doesn\'t attempt to provide near real-time settlement.\\n\\n![xx Network cMixx Dashboard](/img/blog/2024-04-11-xx-cmix-networ-dashboard.png)\\n\\n3000 messages per second is plenty, and can scale as soon as more nodes are added to the network (which is a function of network economics, but ultimately driven by demand which is currently a community decision and later may become a function of postage fees - more users, more nodes chasing their share of xx Network cMixx postage).\\n\\n## Take-away\\n\\nI\'m not optimistic about this development now and the prospects for crypto-currencies in coming years.\\n\\nBitcoin is already a joke (see the recent news on how almost 50% of mined coins are routed to a single address - presumably almost 50% of \\"virgin coins\\" are bought by Wall Street custodians) and Ethereum isn\'t far behind (just wait until the first ETFs appear - it\'s going to be worse, because of staking which lets Wall Street farm virgin coins directly).\\n\\nCrypto-enthusiasts think they (or \\"someone\\") can ignore what governments do \\"because decentralized\\". That works only until they knock on your door.\\n\\nxx Network (Proxxy, etc.) can help and will help to some extent, but in a NWO environment it still can be stopped.\\n\\nThe only way this can be solved in the long term is by fighting centralization and that means civic engagement against globalists, dictators and autocrats - from the UN over governments of large political unions down to small countries. \\n\\nCode is law, but not the law."},{"id":"2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-06-i-like-wrapped-xx-coin.md","title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","description":"What I like about WXX and what I look forward to","date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"cryptocurrency","permalink":"/blog/tags/cryptocurrency"},{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"defi","permalink":"/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":9.16,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin","title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["cryptocurrency","xx network","defi"],"description":"What I like about WXX and what I look forward to","keywords":["evm","wxx","xx coin","erc20","snowbridge","hypernova","substrate","dex","polkadot","cex","supra"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view"},"nextItem":{"title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users"}},"content":"- [Why it\'s good](#why-its-good)\\n- [Why it\'s important](#why-its-important)\\n- [What\'s not so good](#whats-not-so-good)\\n- [Scavengers welcome](#scavengers-welcome)\\n- [More to come](#more-to-come)\\n- [Wrap-up](#wrap-up)\\n\\n\\nPatCrypt created a great [post](https://patcrypt.com/wxx-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wrapped-xx-coin/) about the Wrapped XX coin aka WXX with the contract address `0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2` (view it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2)).\\n\\n## Why it\'s good\\n\\nThe main benefits are already called out by Pat:\\n\\n> - Compatibility with the major Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs)\\n> - A shorter route to being listed by Centralised Exchanges (CEXs)\\n\\nThere\'s a lot to like about that, obviously, especially since:\\n\\n- At least one CEX recently rejected xx coin because \\"it\'s a privacy coin\\" (except that it\'s not - I wrote about that [here](/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users/))\\n- The globalists have been making progress with their plan to \\"allow but disable\\" private cryptocurrencies\\n- Because of the KYC/AML regulations, listing a coin on a CEX has been expensive for years and now it\'s even worse - it\'s more expensive and more scrutinized\\n\\nBecause of that and because xx coin is not a pump-and-dump/meme coin (although anything that\'s tradeable has people who pump it, and xx coin is no exception), xx coin used to have a hard time getting listed. It\'s been listed on [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com) for some time, but that was about it.\\n\\nI know some vocal MEXC users complain about MEXC (not in the context of xx coin, but in general), but considering it\'s located in a low-hassle country, I think it\'s a great exchange and all things considered, less likely to rat on its users than 90% of other CEX (all the EU-based CEX will have to rat on their users once they codify the latest EU regulations.)\\n\\nIn any case, WXX fixes \\"all of the above\\" (challenges): people will be able to get xx coin on centralized and decentralized markets (and anything in between - more on that later).\\n\\nOf course, just being available on one popular DEX would be enough, but on-chain DEX are not known for great liquidity and they\'re (in my opinion anyway) less user-friendly and less liquid, although this last bit may change as more trading moves to DEX due to the fascist laws passed in communist and capitalist jurisdictions alike. We still want and need CEX exchanges, especially in crypto-friendly jurisdictions (go MEXC!).\\n\\n## Why it\'s important \\n\\nI haven\'t traded xx coin, or any coin for that matter, for many years. I haven\'t (yet) sold any xx coins either. When I have enough for my needs (which I now do), I prefer to do things that interest me - if I have free time I\'d rather [do something interesting and hopefully useful to the community](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container) than trade.\\n\\nWhy do I care, then?\\n\\nBecause WXX is good for things I care about, such as privacy and decentralization. \\n\\nIt is very important that xx coin be easy to trade because - see the post on new EU legislation linked above - xx Network plans to introduce postage (fees for prioritized and/or high volume users of its mixing network layer). \\n\\nIf you can\'t buy xx coin, you can\'t pay for postage (once the feature becomes available). That doesn\'t mean you wouldn\'t be able to use xx Network - its mixnet is now completely free to use and I have no reason to think it won\'t retain a generous free tier even when/if postage kicks in.\\n\\nBut I want xx Network to attract large users who pay postage, because that creates a virtuous circle: demand for xx coin to pay for mixnet postage creates a demand for coins earned (and sold) by mixnet runners (\\"validators\\"), which makes xx Network sustainable for both paid and free users. \\n\\nThis may seem trivial now (hey, it\'s free and it\'s working just fine as-is!), but remember this next time you use Signal and get that donation prompt upon starting the app.\\n\\n## What\'s not so good\\n\\nThere isn\'t much not to like. \\n\\nPatCrypt\'s posts mentions some admin to-do\'s and the fact that WXX is currently semi-centralized (which is what I mentioned \\"something in between\\" a CEX and DEX - even when traded on a DEX, it\'s still semi-centralized until EVM bridge comes about, which should be shortly).\\n\\nA wrapped xx Coin was recently listed on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) where liquidity is thin and it appears there aren\'t many users. One may be reasonably skeptical about WXX as well, but I am optimistic because ERC20 tokens are everywhere. Anyone who owns more than two coins probably has an ERC20-compatible wallet or a CEX account and can easily access any DEX by simply installing an app. XRPL is accessible as well, but I feel its main user base are Ripple-focused users, which is fine but not as large as these new markets.\\n\\n## Scavengers welcome\\n\\nI won\'t put this under good or bad, it\'s something that simply is, and can\'t be judged.\\n\\nAn immediate effect of WXX is that its existence increases opportunities for trading, because the more markets which also means more opportunities for arbitrage. \\n\\nWith xx coin available on MEXC, XRPL, WXX (including DEX-es, each of which may be \\"out of sync\\" with others) and the fact that only MEXC has its own API while integrations for others already exist (for different ERC20 tokens, but it just takes a search-and-replace), it\'s no longer prohibitively expensive to build a bot that trades xx coins among several markets. It takes just one MEXC integration and a xx-focused repurposing of ERC20-compatible code for other markets.\\n\\nIt\'s kind of silly, but necessary. Scavengers exist because they need to exist. The main benefit for the regular buyer (or seller) is they get close to best price and liquidity regardless of where they buy (or sell) their coin. \\n\\nRemember that, initially at least - until an Ethereum bridge is built and WXX decentralized - it may be inconvenient to easily move coins between MEXC, XRPL wrapped coin and WXX coin, but this will get easy for WXX once those to-do\'s are completed. For people who engage in arbitrage and move a lot of coins around this means arbitrage will remain inconvenient until that EVM bridge becomes available.\\n\\n## More to come\\n\\nThree things I\'d like to mention here:\\n\\nFirstly, Pat\'s article does mention [Snowbridge](https://docs.snowbridge.network/), a trustless Polkadot bridge technology which - once completed - will bridge Substrate (Polkadot, initially) and Ethereum - something I\'ve been looking forward to since last year.\\n \\nSnowbridge is now getting attention in the xx community, but I think there still isn\'t enough appreciation for what had to happen in order to get here: the fact that xx Network picked a Substrate-based chain, which is the only reason why Snowbridge is now relevant to xx Network in the first place.\\n\\nThey could have picked some cooler \\"next gen\\" blockchain design with even faster finality and whatnot, but they decided to build on Substrate where all chains and parachains benefit from network effect.\\n\\nPerhaps this isn\'t the best comparison, but Substrate can be compared to the Linux kernel. Once an improvement is implemented - due to permissive licensing - it becomes a new feature that every Linux application can use - all Substrate-based blockchains (\\"Linux applications\\") can easily benefit from it. That\'s why it will be relatively easy for xx chain to benefit from Snowbridge without spending many months on developing novel code just for your own project.\\n\\n(This reminds me - even the development effort for a xx Network EVM bridge (that xx Foundation has awarded a grant for) probably significantly benefits from the ability to reference 3rd party EVM bridge implementations for Substrate chains. That\'s why that doesn\'t take quarters, but only months.)\\n\\nSo again, kudos to David Chaum and the team for making a good choice here. Maybe it wasn\'t a hard choice - naturally a decentralized mixnet project would pick a well-maintained and popular chain with governance features built-in, rather than a niche or new chain that requires a lot of in-house chain development - but it was still a choice and they chose wisely.\\n\\nSecondly, due to network effects of the Substrate chain ecosystem, I think it won\'t take long for Polkadot to take advantage of Supra\'s [HyperNova](https://supra.com/news/HyperNova-Consensus/). Punchline:\\n\\n> In short, Supra verifies Ethereum\u2019s L1 consensus cryptographically. \\n\\nIn other words (please visit that link to find out more), Supra\'s HyperNova *does not* need staked bridges that create multi-signature transactions. \\n\\nThe quoted part mentions Ethereum, obviously because that is likely to be the first target for Supra, but the same design applies to other L1 chains. \\n\\nHyperNova is a new design and quarters may pass before it becomes available. But once it does, if Polkadot gets integrated, it becomes easy for xx Chain to get integrated as well. That means a Supra-wrapped xx coin could become instantly available on Supra in a decentralized, management-free and derisked (considering it\'s bridgeless) manner. \\n\\nThirdly, the benefits of Substrate flow in both directions. It is easy for other Substrate projects to connect with xx chain (not just for trading, but for on-chain identity, native assets held, balances, voting history, and other information xx chain holds). You can take a look at the Crust Network (based on a Substrate chain) documentation to see how they have a separate section for integration with Substrate-based chains, for example.\\n\\nThey recently released Ethereum integrations, but even in that case, it\'s nice to have a choice and be able to easily integrate semi-natively using the familiar Polkadot SDK. Ethereum bridges have many advantages (see WXX), but also adds a bit of complexity, risk, round-trip-time and cost. It\'s not the only answer. \\n\\nxx Wallet was able to showcase native Crust Network integration by making their application code to load in one\'s xx wallet. I haven\'t looked if there are multi-coin wallets for Substrate and how they work, but they could make it easy to do buy xx coin for postage and use the purchased \\"message tokens\\" to pay for (xx) mixnet (proxied API) traffic created by Web 3 apps that work on other Substrate chains. It may take a year or two, but it\'s doable.\\n\\nThese are just three examples - there must be more - where Substrate (Polkadot SDK) can take care of 80% of the plumbing. It is much appreciated, but still widely underappreciated!\\n\\n## Wrap-up\\n\\nWXX makes xx coin available to all ERC20-capable wallets and markets. \\n\\nThis is a product of hard and smart work by xx Network developers (including the wise choice to use Polkadot SDK) and the wider Substrate and crypto community.\\n\\nAlso because of Substrate, the best is yet to come. \\n\\n- an integration with Snowbridge could give xx coin a *native and trustless* xx-chain-to-Ethereum bridging \\n- Supra HyperNova - this would also require an xx chain-specific, but not unique, integration and would enable a direct, trustless *and bridgeless* xx-to-Supra cross-chain interoperability. I plan to keep an eye on HyperNova, especially if Substrate or Polkadot are mentioned\\n- DEX for native Substrate coins - useful for multi-currency Substrate wallets and shapeshift-like purchases of xx mixnet credits (to pay for postage)"},{"id":"2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-23-eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users.md","title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","description":"Anti-privacy legislation puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"cryptocurrency","permalink":"/blog/tags/cryptocurrency"}],"readingTime":4.275,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users","title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["cryptocurrency"],"description":"Anti-privacy legislation puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","keywords":["law","privacy","anonymous","monero","xx coin","eu","aml","AML Package","AMLD6"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What I like about the Wrapped XX coin (WXX)","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to use xx Network CLI","permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client"}},"content":"## Draconian anti-privacy regulations \\n\\ncryptotimes.io [reports](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/03/23/eus-new-aml-laws/) on the new anti-money laundering (AML) legislation in the EU:\\n\\n> The new regulations place restrictions on the use of cash.

Their choices are becoming very limited.\\n\\nEU residents who continue Monero advocacy on centralized social media have two choices:\\n\\n- inform the government about their Monero transactions\\n- not use Monero at all\\n\\nThose who continue using Monero and do not plan reporting their transactions will be at risk and likely disappear from centralized social media to lower their risk profile.\\n\\nOne group that won\'t be at risk is Monero speculators and traders, but we don\'t need to consider this group as the number of centralized exchanges with Monero pairs in the EU is very limited (and declining) and at the same time using a decentralized exchange for trading and speculation automatically makes one a person who uses anonymous crypto transactions and likely well over the limit.\\n\\nCriminals are the group that will be least affected, that much is sure. \\n\\n## xx coin is unaffected\\n\\nDavid Chaum\'s idea to not make xx coin a privacy coin was very smart. \\n\\nI must admit initially I wanted more privacy features for xx coin, but in hindsight the man knew what he was doing!\\n\\nxx Network and xx chain protect privacy of messages which helps crypto and Web3 users make their transactions and applications much more private, but the coin that runs xx chain is not a privacy coin.\\n\\nThis lower exposure to legislative risks makes it easier for the xx Network community to grow and the coin doesn\'t even need to be widely used for payments.\\n\\n**Staking** - available today - allow nominators to get a return on staked coins.\\n\\nThe first, still missing piece, is work-in-progress: **xx coin on decentralized exchanges**. Today wrapped xx coin is available on [XRPL](https://xrpl.org/), but there is work in progress on EVM bridge which will make it possible to trade xx coin on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nEventually xx coin will be used to pay **postage (xxPostage) for premium traffic on xx Network**, which will create demand for it. By then it should be easy to buy it on decentralized cryptocurrency  exchanges.\\n\\nxx coin is not used in mainstream P2P crypto payments and speculation (which is easy to check by looking at turnover). So far its main use case is staking.\\n\\nBecause no coin ownership or transactions are required for participation, EU-based fans of xx Network promote privacy and use the cMix services without holding a single xx coin!\\n\\n## Take-aways\\n\\nMost EU-based promoters of the top privacy coins will gradually cease using their coins in ways that protect privacy. What will they promote then?\\n\\nSome will hodl and drop out, while few others may pump and dump their cons for as long as those coins are listed on a centralized exchange.\\n\\nThose who remain active on centralized social media are very likely *not* going to be the user of the very coin they promote. \\n\\nI therefore expect a significant drop in social media presence of *real* EU-based users of privacy coins. \\n\\nDr. Chaum picked a different way to fight the good fight and latest changes in the EU regulations related to AML do not affect xx Network any more than they affect the regular privacy-less coin. Not to mention that all of us can use the main thing we advocate - xx Network - without any transactions on the xx blockchain. For most users that means no transactions, no reporting and no regulations to worry about."},{"id":"2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-09-xx-network-cli-irc-like-client.md","title":"How to use xx Network CLI","description":"How to get started with xx Network CLI client","date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"}],"readingTime":5.92,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client","title":"How to use xx Network CLI","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network"],"description":"How to get started with xx Network CLI client","keywords":["xx network","chat","broadcast","cli","text","client","irc"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position","permalink":"/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users"},"nextItem":{"title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt"}},"content":"## Introduction \\n\\nxx Network is a privacy-focused, quantum-resistant \\"small messaging\\" network.\\n\\nBy \\"small messaging\\" I mean up to KB-sized messages, although it\'s possible to use larger messages as well. For example, xx Messenger supports small attachments (tens of KB).\\n\\nxx CLI client is a reference client implementation for xx Network that at this time uses the older \\"broadcast module layer\\" approach. \\n\\nSpeakeasy (Haven) or Echoexx use a better approach (channels), but all of them use the xx Network SDK (xxDK). \\n\\nxx CLI client repository has a read-me file that contains almost all the steps required to get started, but this post can still save you some time.\\n\\n## Build\\n\\nAt this time we need `go1.21`, but check the source to verify if this requirement changed.\\n\\nThese steps are for Linux. Check the repository\'s read-me file for other OS.\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://git.xx.network/elixxir/cli-client && cd cli-client/\\ngo mod vendor && go mod tidy\\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags \'-w -s\' -o xx-client main.go\\n```\\n:::info\\nOn ARM64 devices, use `GOARCH=arm64` or omit `GOARCH` (it should be detected automatically).\\n:::\\n\\n## Use xx CLI\\n\\nLet\'s see how to use xx CLI client.\\n\\n### First user\\n\\nSomeone needs to create a broadcast (chat) first.\\n\\nWe can do that with `--new`, and give your broadcast a name and a description. \\n\\nSetup procedure creates 2 files you need to know about: \\n\\n- the first one is the broadcast definition file by default named $CHANNEL.xxchan (here, `test.xxchan`)\\n- the second is a private RSA key for the creator who is also channel admin. This one is by default named `$CHANNEL-privateKey.pem` (here, `test-privateKey.pem`).\\n\\n```sh\\nexport NICK=\\"my-Name\\"\\n./xx-client broadcast --new -o test.xxchan -n \\"test\\" -d \\"Some desc\\"\\n./xx-client broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n./xx-client.linux64 broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n# in case of timeouts try logLevel 1 or 2 with: --logLevel 1\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\n`test.xxchan` is the broadcast definition file which enables another party to listen to this broadcast. Secure it if your broadcast is private.\\n:::\\n\\nThe default wait timeout value wasn\'t enough, so I extended it with `--waitTimeout`. \\n\\nThe reason is lately some xx Network gateway nodes had difficulties (potentially due to government interference in some countries) which makes it harder to connect. There\'s a log file which you can tail from another terminal to see that.\\n\\nIf you want to use a self-supplied RSA key, use `--key ${FILENAME}` to specify the RSA private key file, such as `--key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_xxcli`.\\n\\n### Second user\\n\\nThe second user needs the broadcast definition file, as there\'s no way to establish chat without it. \\n\\n:::warning\\nShare the broadcast file through Signal or use some other secure sharing method. A chat is no more secure than the medium through which this file has been shared.\\n:::\\n\\nThe second user would normally have another nickname (although they\'re really identified by their private key) and needs to only load the channel, not create it. \\n\\nHere we\'ll create the RSA key manually before we start (as we don\'t need to create a channel). This also means you can reuse existing RSA key if you have it.\\n\\n```sh\\nexport NICK=\\"AnotherGuy\\"\\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f AnotherGuyKeyfile\\n# move your new private key to the default private key file name for the chat \\"test\\"\\nmv AnotherGuyKeyfile test-privateKey.pem\\n# test.xxchan is the configuration file obtained from the first party\\n./xx-client.linux64 broadcast --load -o test.xxchan -u $NICK --waitTimeout 120s\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nFor each client we use a different terminal (or different client altogether). Different chats use different broadcast definition files.\\n:::\\n\\nAnd that is it!\\n\\n![xx Network CLI](/img/xx-network-cli-01.png)\\n\\nThere are minor console-related bugs, and you\'ll need to reconnect (simply CTRL+C and then restart) if you get disconnected. \\n\\n## Other details\\n\\nThere are other details that you can find from online help, or by inspecting the code.\\n\\n```raw\\nAvailable Commands:\\n  broadcast   Create or join broadcast channels.\\n  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell\\n  generate    Generates version and dependency information for the binary.\\n  help        Help about any command\\n  version     Print the version and dependency information for the binary.\\n\\nFlags:\\n  -c, --config string          Path to YAML file with custom configuration..\\n  -h, --help                   help for cli-client\\n  -v, --logLevel int           Verbosity level for log printing (2+ = Trace, 1 = Debug, 0 = Info).\\n  -l, --logPath string         File path to save log file to. (default \\"cli-client.log\\")\\n      --ndf string             Path to the network definition JSON file. By default, the prepacked NDF is used.\\n  -p, --password string        Password to the session file.\\n  -s, --session string         Sets the initial storage directory for client session data. (default \\"session\\")\\n      --waitTimeout duration   Duration to wait for messages to arrive. (default 15s)\\n```\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\nxx CLI client cannot communicate with Speakeasy or Echoexx - as noted earlier, these use different module of xxDK.\\n\\nBut it can be useful on its own. Some examples:\\n\\n- secure & private DM or group chat client for headless and remote systems without X Window System - like IRC, but with fewer features and more secure and private\\n- share IT-related secrets such as passwords and .env files with yourself or colleagues: load channel file, start the client, send or receive secrets and then delete the entire directory on the temporary client \\n\\nA bit more on this last use case. You should use encrypted boot volume or change the secret if it\'s critical, as it\'s not technically possible to shred/wipe a single file on an unencrypted flash disk. For this use case you need to be able to get out to the Internet which is often, but not always (e.g. LAN) possible.\\n\\nThere are CLI scripts for \\"secure\\" password sharing, but they rely on personal infrastructure (some server & DB which may or may not be secure), or 3rd party infrastructure which may or may not be more secure than xx Network (and often doesn\'t have open source code on both the server and client).\\n\\nThere\'s also Tailscale, but again - to be equally secure, you still have to encrypt your data before sending it and probably at-rest as well (considering that the client is \\"online\\" at all times). If you can make use of Tailscale for other things that\'s great, but if you need something quick - like when setting up some VMs in the cloud - xx CLI client could be good enough.\\n\\nxx CLI client could also be modified for other purposes, for example as a low censorship-free broadcast tool without the need for Tor (which mony networks block in any case). Access to the xx Network gateways can also be blocked, but most jurisdictions and corporate firewalls haven\'t done it yet.\\n\\nAs of now, xx Network gateways retain client side-encrypted data for 21 days, after which it expires and may be found only on the clients (if they logged in and downloaded it before it expired). So, keep in mind that you may shred the local session file, channel file and private key to disable access locally, while chat data stored on xx Network gateways expires in weeks. What you cannot delete is the messages other clients received on their side without access to those clients."},{"id":"2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-05-security-text-file.md","title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","description":"Case for xx Network Haven chat link in security.txt","date":"2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"haven","permalink":"/blog/tags/haven"}],"readingTime":2.58,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt","title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","haven"],"description":"Case for xx Network Haven chat link in security.txt","keywords":["xx network","haven","security.txt","chat","contact"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to use xx Network CLI","permalink":"/blog/2024/02/09/xx-network-cli-irc-like-client"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","permalink":"/blog/2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify"}},"content":"## security.txt\\n\\nThe Dutch Digital Trust Center mandates that all government sites must have a security files under the `.well-known` directory located at the root of Web site.\\n\\nUse cases:\\n\\n- Go-to place to get information on how to report vulnerabilities affecting the site or organization\\n- Improve the speed of getting in touch\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nhttps://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt captured on Jun 1, 2023.\\n\\n```raw\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\nHash: SHA512\\n\\n# Domeinen van de Rijksoverheid kunnen met een 302 redirect verwijzen naar\\n# het centrale bestand op https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt\\n# omdat het NCSC het centrale meldpunt is voor kwetsbaarheden en incidenten\\n# voor de Rijksoverheid.\\n#\\n# Dutch central government domains can redirect to the central file located\\n# at https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt with a 302 redirect,\\n# because NCSC-NL is the central point of contact for vulnerabilities and\\n# incidents for the Dutch central government.\\n\\nExpires: 2024-01-31T22:59:00.000Z\\nCanonical: https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt\\n\\nPolicy: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden\\nPolicy: https://english.ncsc.nl/contact/reporting-a-vulnerability-cvd\\n\\nContact: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden\\nContact: https://english.ncsc.nl/contact/reporting-a-vulnerability-cvd\\nContact: mailto:security@ncsc.nl\\nEncryption: https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/pgp-key\\nPreferred-Languages: nl, en\\n\\nAcknowledgments: https://www.ncsc.nl/wall-of-fame\\nHiring: https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: Encryption Desktop 10.4.2 (Build 1298)\\nCharset: utf-8\\n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\\nlNVMWzOncidAWM0nXcuYTjZagRAagthF\\n=yC4A\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n```\\n\\n## Use case for Haven\\n\\n- security.txt is PGP-signed to confirm that it was signed by the key owner and that\'s fine. But in reality most people hate to use it to compose emails or messages\\n- it is time-consuming for the recipient to download every sender\'s key which also delays reading encrypted messages\\n- Haven gives the reporter anonymity, both parties enjoy encryption and privacy, and can interact in real time (and still move to email if they so choose)\\n- Haven uses quantum-resistant encryption (I haven\'t checked, but it should be superior to PGP)\\n\\nHaven public chat link can be added to security.txt. Example: \\n\\n```raw\\nChat: https://.............. (security vulnerabilities only)\\nContact: email - mailto:.........; chat - send DM to `aCertainTestifier`\\nEncryption: https://www..../contact/pgp-key\\n```\\n\\nBecause public chat could have several permanently present strangers in it, direct messages (DM) should be sent to contact person.\\n\\nWhat are the weaknesses of using Haven here? \\n\\nThe way I see it, the biggest is that xx Network keeps messages for 21 days and then they disappear. To prevent the situation where nothing happens for three weeks and messages disappear, the reporting person should move on to email if no response is received within hours.\\n\\nWith time, spam may become a problem for Haven. But it is already a problem for email now, so Haven is not worse.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nHaven uses xx Network to store encrypted messages and Haven users can connect to xx Network from any (trusted) application server - whether it\'s container on own desktop client, the official Haven instance, etc. \\n\\nCompared to an email or Web service as means of communication, Haven is less likely to be affected by a vulnerability at the same time as your corporate email or Web service, so it is a cost-free, \\"out-of-band\\" solution that\'s more resistant to unplanned concurrent downtime or DDoS.\\n\\nHaven gives you zero maintenance, quantum-resistant encryption, superior privacy (compared to email and PGP), and far more convenience."},{"id":"2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-08-xx-network-wallet-sign-verify/index.md","title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","description":"Use the official xx Network Web wallet to sign and verify messages","date":"2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"xx network","permalink":"/blog/tags/xx-network"},{"label":"sign","permalink":"/blog/tags/sign"},{"label":"verify","permalink":"/blog/tags/verify"},{"label":"wallet","permalink":"/blog/tags/wallet"}],"readingTime":1.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ArmchairAncap","url":"https://github.com/armchairancap","imageURL":"https://github.com/armchairancap.png","key":"armchairancap"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023/05/08/xx-network-wallet-sign-verify","title":"Sign and verify messages using xx Network wallet","authors":["armchairancap"],"tags":["xx network","sign","verify","wallet"],"description":"Use the official xx Network Web wallet to sign and verify messages","keywords":["xx network","cryptographically","sign","message","validate","signature"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Case for xx Network chat link in security.txt","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/05/xx-network-chat-security-dot-txt"},"nextItem":{"title":"Install xx Network Haven","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/30/install-xx-network-haven"}},"content":"## Sign\\n\\nGo to `Developer` > `Sign and Verify` > `Sign message`\\n\\nPick an address (\\"wallet\\") to use and enter a message or other data you wish to sign with your wallet key to `sign the following data`. \\n\\nThis may be any text such as your Speakeasy codename, email address, etc.\\n\\n![Sign message from xx Network wallet](xx-network-wallet-sign.png)\\n\\nClick on the copy icon to copy the signature (`signature of supplied data`) to clipboard. \\n\\n## Verify\\n\\nTo verify, go to `Verify signature` rather than `Sign and Verify`.\\n\\n`Verify using address` means the signer\'s wallet address (so, usually not your own).\\n\\nYou need to provide the same wallet and message that you got, and if everything checks out, the icon next to `the supplied signature` will become a green check mark.\\n\\nBad signatures will fail to verify.\\n\\n![Bad signature fails to verify](xx-network-wallet-verify-bad-hash.png)\\n\\nBad data will also fail to verify against a correct signature.\\n\\n![Correct signature and content verify](xx-network-wallet-verify-incomplete.png)\\n\\nTo be successful, verification requires the same wallet, message data and signature that were used to generate the signature.\\n\\n![Correct verification](xx-network-wallet-verify.png)\\n\\n## Non-deterministic signatures\\n\\nxx Network uses Schnorrkel (sr25519) which doesn\'t create deterministic signatures.\\n\\nFor example, I created two additional signatures.

If you have Docker or Postman and want to run Haven in a container, try [this](https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container).\\n\\nIn the case you want to self-host a non-containerized Haven, read on!\\n\\n## Home or cloud\\n\\nYou may install Speakeasy at home or in the cloud.\\n\\nHaven Web server doesn\'t hold any data but its OS and Node.js logs may store client IPs, that\'s all. \\n\\nWith that in mind, some high-level considerations would be:\\n\\n- We don\'t want our Speakeasy Web app or underlying OS to get compromised\\n- If your Haven is not open to public, or is accessed \\"by invite\\" (maybe with basic authentication or VPN, for your family and friends), you may run it at home\\n- If your Haven is located in the cloud, that\'s acceptable as long as you can protect it from getting compromised so that application code doesn\'t get replaced, OS compromised, or visitors\' IPs leaked.\\n\\nRegarding this last point, if you feel comfortable hosting your Haven server in a small (1G RAM) VM, it is better to open it to public to have the Web server accessed by a variety of addresses. As long as you know how to protect the VM.\\n\\n:::tip\\nEach participant in a conversation can use a different Speakeasy Web server, so many deployment combinations are possible.\\n:::\\n\\n## Software and hardware requirements\\n\\nUse a Linux OS or VM, x86_64 or ARM64 architecture. Haven\'s hardware requirements are minimal:\\n\\n- 1 vCPU\\n- 1 GB RAM\\n- 3 GB disk\\n\\nAll Haven app/web server does is serve the app to the client(s) and that\'s one-time download from each client (around 100 MB download).\\n\\nOne vCPU is enough and won\'t be significantly utilized except when Node.js builds the application or when container image is updated - that takes a long time (15 minutes), but has to be done only when Haven code is updated or rebuilt.\\n\\n## Install Node.js\\n\\nOn generic Linux OS, follow installation instructions for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above.\\n\\nThis post was prototyped on DietPi Linux, which currently uses Node.js 20. On DietPi, you may install Node.js as follows:\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo dietpi-software install 9\\n```\\n\\nOr, run `dietpi-software`, select `Search software`, search for `Node.js`, and proceed with installation.\\n\\n## Deploy and run Speakeasy\\n\\nWe need to pick a directory for the application, clone the source to that directory, change some parameters and install.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/src/app/speakeasy/.next\\n```\\n\\nIf your username is joe, you could run it as such. Otherwise, create a non-sudoer account and use that.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo chown -R joe:joe /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\n```\\n\\nThat should allow you to run the rest without using `sudo`.\\n\\nNext, clone the Haven source code, change configuration parameters and run it.\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://git.xx.network/elixxir/speakeasy-web /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\ncd /usr/src/app/speakeasy\\n```\\n\\n### Pick Haven Web application port \\n\\nMost Node.js apps traditionally use port 3000, but you\'ll need something else if you have another app using that port.\\n\\nPick a port for Haven, such as 7080, and use it consistently later:\\n\\n```sh\\nsed -i \'s/next start/next start -p 7080/g\' package.json\\nsed -i \'s/const nextConfig = {/const nextConfig ={\\\\\\\\n  productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,/g\' next.config.js\\nrm -rf node_modules && npm install -g npm@9.6.5 && npm install && npx next telemetry disable && npx next build\\n```\\n\\nIf that went well, you can try to start it from the same directory.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nCheck if Haven is up and running by going to `http://${SERVER_IP}:7080`. You may need to open OS firewall for that. Example for Ubuntu:\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw allow 7080/tcp\\n```\\n\\nSince that port doesn\'t need to be exposed when Speakeasy is running behind HTTPS proxy, it is advisable to delete the rule after testing the application.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw status numbered\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou won\'t be able to do much with Speakeasy running at `http://host:7080` because there\'s no reverse HTTPS proxy in front of Speakeasy. If you attempt to create an identity you will get stuck at the `Find your Codename` step. \\n\\nAssuming the rules for 7080/tcp are number 7 and 8, and your HTTPS reverse proxy will run on the same host, you can delete the rules: `sudo ufw delete 7 ; sudo ufw delete 8`.\\n\\nThe right firewall port to open on the *host* would be whatever port is used by your HTTPS reverse proxy (e.g. 14443).\\n\\n:::tip\\nTo be fully functional, Haven must be accessed through an HTTPS reverse proxy.\\n:::\\n\\n## Reverse HTTPS proxy\\n\\nDeploy reverse HTTPS proxy in front of Speakeasy so that external port is forwarded to Speakeasy\'s application port (example: `https://fqdn:14443` -> `http://localhost:7080`). To use 14443/tcp, open that firewall port on external network.\\n\\n```sh\\nsudo ufw allow 14443/tcp\\n```\\n\\nNow configure HTTPS reverse proxy to forward incoming 14443/tcp to 7080/tcp, and if you wish make HTTPS reverse proxy and Speakeasy Web app start (`npm start`) automatically.\\n\\nFor that you may use Caddy, Traefik, NGINX or other. \\n\\nThere are many ways to deploy each reverse proxy and at the same time there are no Speakeasy-specific steps here, so the details are an exercise for the reader. Find and try the official or community examples for your proxy and Node.js.\\n\\n### Custom port, host or path\\n\\nIn the case Speakeasy is the only application proxied by HTTPS reverse proxy, it is most convenient to expose it at `https://host:443`.\\n\\nIn the case the same HTTPS reverse proxy is used for several applications, Speakeasy can be hosted in a directory (or, more complicated, at a dedicated virtual host name or FQDN).\\n\\n### TLS certificate\\n\\nIn any and all cases, your reverse HTTPS proxy would need a TLS certificate.\\n\\nIf your reverse proxy integrates with Let\'s Encrypt, you could expose reverse proxy (and indirectly Speakeasy) to the Internet rather than use internal or even self-signed TLS certificate - it\'s more secure, especially if you additionally protect HTTPS proxy with firewall rules or basic (or other) authentication.\\n\\nHaven Web server doesn\'t host any account or chat data. If you expose Speakeasy to the Internet, the main concern is to prevent NodeJS from application server take-over and tampering, so it can be advantageous to run it using a limited local account, and optionally add some form of authentication to your HTTPS proxy.\\n\\nOnce a TLS-enabled proxy is functional, you can access Haven, create a new codename or import existing, and start using Haven.\\n\\n## Update Haven\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Haven can be simply wiped and re-installed because only serves the application code and does not store any client data.\\n\\nThe official instance (haven.xx.network) normally runs the latest version, so visit that site from time to time, or watch the Speakeasy repository for new releases, or follow xx Network on Twitter."}]}}')}}]);
