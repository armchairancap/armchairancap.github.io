<p>Some people who advocate DEXes are decentralization fanatics, others are conspiracy theorists, and some &quot;all of the above&quot;.</p>
<p>There are also pragmatists in this group. In this post I share my pragmatic arguments in favor of moving your active stash to a DEX.</p>
<p>Note that this is specific to Supra and my own purpose, which is to see the project grow and, with it, the value it provides to its ecosystem. More value means more growth and a higher coin price. I view Supra as my &quot;enterprise&quot; blockchain holding: I&#x27;d like it to see grow as a normal for-profit business would.</p>

<p>In the case of Supra, I don&#x27;t think centralization is bad. I simply don&#x27;t like how <em>these particular unregulated guys</em> run their business.</p>
<p>Another special circumstance is Supra is a good L1 platform for DEX markets, so I also have - all Supra holders and stakers <em>should have</em> - a conflict of interest in their mind.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="current-supra-listing-cexes">Current Supra-listing CEXes<a href="#current-supra-listing-cexes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Supra-listing CEXes" title="Direct link to Current Supra-listing CEXes">​</a></h2>
<p>I don&#x27;t expect to add anything new here, as cryptocurrency DEXes have been around for a decade or more, and pragmatic arguments against CEXes have been around longer.</p>
<p>Briefly, from the viewpoint explained above (meaning: pragmatic, Supra-specific arguments from an enterprise POV), this is what&#x27;s wrong with CEXes (especially the unregulated ones):</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of transparency: this is really the worst part</li>
<li>Poor business practices: we don&#x27;t know who and how (why, because no transparency) not only in terms of transparency, but also in terms of governance</li>
<li>Leverage (Futures): this isn&#x27;t bad in itself (it also exists on regulated CEXes, and on DEXes), but I think it&#x27;s a major tool used in market manipulation because it&#x27;s likely used <em>against retail users</em> on unregulated CEXes</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the lack of transparency, folks on X like to make fun of crypto/DeFi fans saying cypherpunks, who claimed zero regulation was good, start whining when their altcoin gets smashed on the same markets. I agree with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>I may decide to participate in a zero-regulation market (a DEX, for example) and I won&#x27;t whine if lose</li>
<li>Zero-regulation (or &quot;extremely lax&quot; regulation) CEX could work if these exchanges voluntarily shared data that should be shared. But they don&#x27;t share anything of substance, while regulated CEXes probably collect and share too much, which increases costs for no benefit to users. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;in-between&quot; which is a shame</li>
</ul>

For example, most of these are still true:</p><ul>
<li>Low latency, very suitable for <em>frequent</em> trading</li>
<li>Better features for advanced traders (such as leverage, automation, APIs, clients)</li>
<li>Convenience (in some cases)</li>
</ul><p>CEXes still command close to 80% of crypto spot trading and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using them. People say &quot;not your private keys not your coins&quot;, but I would guess more people lost their coins in self-custody than at CEXes.</p></div></div>
<p>Now I&#x27;ll give some anecdotal examples of how unregulated CEXes suck.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="governance">Governance<a href="#governance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Governance" title="Direct link to Governance">​</a></h3>
<p>Transparency is sometimes legally mandated, but for unregulated exchanges it&#x27;s merely a choice.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing that prevents them from busting manipulators, reporting money launderes, and such. From what I can tell the unregulated CEXes where Supra is listed are doing the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Another area of governance is operations. If you work for a regulated FSI player you&#x27;re simply <em>not allowed</em> to do certain things the weird or wrong way. There are checks and checks of checks.</p>
<p>For example, using plain text passwords could be grounds for dismissal, and you&#x27;ll get discovered because in the regulated world Operations are not in charge of Security - there&#x27;s a Security team who audits and checks Operations. But the ByBit guy transferred $1.5B to the North Korean hackers because ByBit used a DIY workflow &quot;invented&quot; by ByBit where security practices failed. Had they followed established practices in place in the UK or US, they&#x27;d work slower, safer and more expensively. They probably didn&#x27;t like the speed and cost of the more &quot;regulated&quot; approach and thought they were smarter... Fortunately ByBit - and with it its Supra users - survived (for now).</p>
<p>This argument applies to DEXes as well (were bugs may go undetected due to corner cutting in development, operations or auditing), but it&#x27;s not an argument against <em>regulated</em> CEXes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no Western (regulated) CEX list Supra at this time, so there&#x27;s no &quot;better&quot; CEX we can go to.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="market-m-ing">Market M-ing<a href="#market-m-ing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Market M-ing" title="Direct link to Market M-ing">​</a></h3>
<p>One example of poor transparency is market making (or manipulating...  - with unregulated CEXes you can&#x27;t even know which it is).</p>
<p>Consider this screenshot of trades in SUPRA/USDT (Spot) taken yesterday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Market M-ing at a CEX yesterday" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_02_dex_mm-df7fa6e0f0995c1d2cbd72eac64be57c.png" width="437" height="426" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> normal. A market <strong>maker</strong> would create buy and sell orders and let others <strong>take</strong> them.</p>
<p>But we can see here both buys and sells are happening and only of these particular orders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there no other buyers/sellers whose order would be in this list?</li>
<li>Why would anyone who&#x27;s a <em>maker</em> buy <em>and</em> sell within seconds like that? A <em>taker</em> would, but a <em>maker</em> would not.</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks like market manipulation more than market making to me.</p>
<p>At times, the MM guys go on a day trip or take a day off, and then you see the extent of it:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Market M-ing at a CEX yesterday" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_03_dex_mm_mia-318ed89c3ef8247e07184fee409bb218.png" width="1127" height="467" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>I checked the smaller pair on this exchange, SUPRA/USDC, and it&#x27;s even worse there. (There the making/manipulation is probably ran by some USDC-outsourced marketing guys who are supposed to aid USDC adoption.)</p>
<p>Again, the problem here isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s a market &quot;maker&quot;. The problem is that they&#x27;re a &quot;taker&quot;. They <em>actively trade</em>.</p>
<p>If you make a market, you create buy/sell orders that others &quot;take&quot;&quot; (by issuing matching sell/buy orders). If there&#x27;s no genuine activity, market maker&#x27;s orders just sit there for the time when a user comes, to have liquidity to sell or buy into. Market makers aren&#x27;t supposed to impact the price.</p>
<p>Seeing a lot more volume when they&#x27;re not day-tripping means when they&#x27;re gone there&#x27;s no trading. Obviously, this means bots are rampant. These MM guys engage in wash trading (to create appearance of activity) and various forms of market manipulation all deemed illegal in regulated markets.</p>
<p>And, related to transparency, you don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s MM-ing, who&#x27;s paying them, and if they&#x27;re actively trading against exchange&#x27;s retail users. But, you&#x27;d probably be right if you assumed the worst (such as, that these deregulated CEXes don&#x27;t care what kind of MM-ing - making or manipulation - goes on).</p>

<p>Some &quot;crypto people&quot; told me I&#x27;m nit-picking, and &quot;it&#x27;s all MM&quot;. <em>That is nonsense</em>. If you <em>take</em> orders, meaning create matching bids for existing buy or sell orders, you directly impact the price and secondly, you earn or lose from such trades. And because of that, you&#x27;ll obviously try to profit, and the result is you&#x27;re now <em>trading against CEX users</em>. You can&#x27;t profit unless they lose. So what, you may ask?</p>
<ul>
<li>The CEX can obviously see (see the screenshot at the top) that you&#x27;re <em>taking</em> orders i.e. trading against users, which is the first problem</li>
<li>The second problem is they can also easily see you&#x27;re entering short positions in one place (such as Spot) and long (such as Futures) in another, for the same pair. That is, you&#x27;re clearly there to manipulate the price by creating artifical price swings. You&#x27;re not either selling or buying</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the difference between a Market Maker and a regular user with an AI bot? If you&#x27;re a Market Maker, not a Manipulator, no regulated exchange will let you do that. Even Binance (not the gold standard by any means) won&#x27;t allow it. From the Binance link above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General reminder that all projects’ authorized market makers on Binance must comply with the principals and rules as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place orders for <em>both</em> bid and ask</li>
<li>Ensure orders remain for a certain amount of time, and prevent market disruption from high-frequency order placement and cancellations</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When a Market Maker violates the rules (in the Binance case), what happens is although they&#x27;re authorized (and usually paid by someone) to make markets, provide liquidity and build trust, they start acting on behalf of other &quot;customers&quot; (they trade on own behalf or maybe even on behalf of other manipulators, to assist others to manipulate the market they make). Extremely bad!</p>
<p>Although it may seem such dishonest Market Makers could simply become general exchange users and do whatever they want, that isn&#x27;t the case. Regulated CEXes do not allow market manipulation explained above, even if it&#x27;s done by regular users.</p>
<p>Degens would object to anything that comes from the SEC, so I&#x27;ll provide an example from the FCA (UK).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="FCA anti-manipulation rules" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_11_fca_manipulation-0a92dd07733ddedeaeb6f56899935b34.png" width="665" height="444" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>There&#x27;s more <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/MAR/1/6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and elsehwere.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;everything ought to be regulated&quot;. DEXes aren&#x27;t either. But <em>as a customer of unregulated CEXes</em>, I&#x27;m not very happy about this arrangement. These guys have low fees, but they probably &quot;double-dip&quot; - provide access to and collect fees from, the people who trade unethically against other customers.</p>

<p>In numeric order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust score (a proprietary metric by Coin Gecko) is missing and who knows if the stats reported by the exchange can be trusted. Business as usual...</li>
<li>Ridiculously high volume. What&#x27;s going on? Good luck finding out. The exchange is not obliged to share this info or provide aggregate figures of top traders.</li>
<li>Another pair from the same exchange has 1% of total volume on one day, 20% on another. No one asks any questions, because no one is supposed to answer them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;campaign&quot; trading which would normally pique the interest of regulators or even the exchanges themselves to see if some customers are attempting to manipulate prices and hurt retail users.</p>

<p>If I ran an exchange and saw activity jump like this, I&#x27;d take a look to see if someone&#x27;s abusing the platform regardless of whether &quot;regulations&quot; exist or not. In fact I&#x27;d have basic checks built-in and in place for all markets, 24x7, because some problems are easy to spot with automated checks.</p>
<p>But these cowboys don&#x27;t care. Maybe you, as a retail user, couldn&#x27;t take the pressure and dumped your Supra on March 27... SFYL! But, more volume = more fees. End of story.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="perpetual-futures-aka-perps">Perpetual Futures aka Perps<a href="#perpetual-futures-aka-perps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Perpetual Futures aka Perps" title="Direct link to Perpetual Futures aka Perps">​</a></h3>
<p>Perpetual futures are basically entries in a database which is a closed zero-sum system where there is <strong>no Supra involved at all</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#x27;s no USD involved either! Yes, it says <code>SUPRA/USDT</code>, but understand that the market doesn&#x27;t need either.</p>
<ul>
<li>A DB is created, and named after a pair such as <code>SUPRA/USDT</code></li>
<li>To play, gamers deposit USDT &quot;at the entrance&quot; in order to be able to enter and play, but <em>just like Supra</em> (the other side of this pair), the Perps DB does not &quot;use&quot; USDT. It&#x27;s just a database</li>
<li>Next, players play against each other, and the survivors &quot;unlock&quot; thei USDT deposit and collect deposit of other users who&#x27;ve lost, while the CEX retains trading revenues</li>
<li>Players could deposit collateral in gemstones, Litecoin or something else. USDT is simply what&#x27;s most convenient in this case because it maps 1:1 to a side in this pair</li>
<li>Players cannot take Supra out of this market, because there&#x27;s no Supra, as we&#x27;ve said earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, realize that Perps provide leverage - up to 50x.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Supra/USDT Spot Market Leverage" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_04_dex_lev_03-3b33c7e8c0464b1625bf485da5d784f9.png" width="542" height="496" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>There are two interesting things about this.</p>
<p>The first is, players can deposit 10 USDT &quot;at the entrance&quot; and play with 500 USDT. This speeds up the CEX&#x27;es &quot;time to fleecing&quot;. Notice how it also makes $500 available to CEX interest-free. It&#x27;s a closed system so as long as they liquidate overleveraged positions in time, there&#x27;s no chance for the CEX to lose here. This is obviously much better (for CEXes) and worse for customers. Instead of hesitating to send users to Futures section, they employ &quot;dark UI patterns&quot; to <em>attract</em> users to Perps. MEXC won&#x27;t even show Spot in top menu once you enter Futures!</p>
<p>Point 2: with a 50x leverage you can buy, but also sell, 50x more Supra than you could normally sell. That means Perps are the place to go to smash a project or simply cause price-impacting swings in Spot SUPRA/USDT as &quot;the tail is wagging the dog&quot;.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s even worse than that! We said &quot;50x more Supra than you could normally sell&quot;, but in order to <em>sell</em> you&#x27;d have to buy. With Perps not only do you can sell 50x more, but you don&#x27;t have to buy any at all. You deposit USDT at the entrance, lever up 40x, smack Supra, and exit with more USDT in your pockets.</p>
<p>You may wonder why this doesn&#x27;t equally work for buyers. The truth is it does, but that doesn&#x27;t make this setup better. If marketplace owner determines you&#x27;re trading in a way meant to manipulate Spot prices - for example you&#x27;re shorting in Perps with 40x and and have buy orders in Spot - they should step in and do something about that. These cowboy CEXes do not.</p>
<p>I think unregulated cowboy exchanges don&#x27;t do anything about it. If anything, they encourage it.</p>
<p>This is from SUPRA/USDT Perps yesterday and I think it shows a problem. In (2), Perps volume is rapidly incrasing on no big changes in price before 14:26. Why would that happen?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Supra/USDT Perps Market Screenshot" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_04_dex_perps_01-bd1576b7c3fe266912fce59b98cbe9d1.png" width="1574" height="853" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This below is Spot. Selling at scale starts at 14:26.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Supra/USDT Spot Market Screenshot" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_04_dex_perps_02-46eec843acbde9d3fbec8d3f03faa8a9.png" width="1124" height="466" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Perps dump first, Spot follows. Seven percent drop (or over 200% profit, if you&#x27;re leveraged 40x), on no news - the price even (almost) reocvered hours later.</p>
<p>Am I &quot;sure&quot; this is manipulation? Of course I&#x27;m not. As we&#x27;ve said, we have no way to know and they don&#x27;t have to tell us anything...</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t want to play in our casino, go elsewhere&quot; is the message. Enough people want to play in these casinos that there&#x27;s no reason for them to improve.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen enough to know that they&#x27;re often up to no good.</p>
<p>Even without any forensic evidence related to the weird Market M-ing and such, evidence of dark UI patterns exist and is plentiful.</p>
<p>For example, you can see Futures from Spot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="MEXC Perps link" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_07_dark_ui-2ba7b6dca46d116638ced0d9b9a83e37.png" width="1051" height="273" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>But you can&#x27;t see Spot markets from Futures page... Surprise, surprise...</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a one-way street - no link back to Spot!</p>

<p>And as soon as you enter, &quot;Las Vegas experience&quot; kicks in - there are constant promotions for reckless behavior (high leverage, commission free trading), there are casino-like pop-ups, etc.</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve used the early ones on bitcoin network and it was <strong>bad</strong>! I remember how we&#x27;d see a sell order, submit our matching buy order and then wait, and wait, awnd wait - usually for more than 1 hour - before we could see our order on chain (6 confirmations, remember?). Anyone who saw your order in mempool could front-run you if they wanted to pay a slightly higher transaction fee.</p>
<p>Things are better now. This aren&#x27;t &quot;latest and greatest&quot;, but they&#x27;re recent enough (2025). The first is DEX share in Spot volumes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DEX Spot Share" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_05_dex_spot-740d011cc96e94b897b26f9bb289ef15.png" width="519" height="407" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Perps are harder, as mentioned earlier, but both blockchains and DEX tech are getting better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DEX Perps Share" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_06_dex_perps-a7d654e4ff7a4f4bde5637fde3ffaceb.png" width="496" height="444" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>CEXes have noticed. See <a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1883329603239899346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to rethink our listing process at @coinbase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several reasons, but in January commissions from memecoin trading were huge and CEXes just couldn&#x27;t keep up - all the action was happening on Solana, basically.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s not just memecoins, it&#x27;s also &quot;traditional&quot; coins which probably don&#x27;t last long enough and CEXes don&#x27;t want to miss out.</p>
<p>DEXes don&#x27;t solve all the problems with unregulated CEXes mentioned above, and some maybe aren&#x27;t even solvable.</p>
<p>For example, leveraged perpetual futures are also available on on-chain DEXes. But <strong>at least</strong> you don&#x27;t lend your own funds to a CEX interest-free to use them against you.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="dex-benefits-to-you-and-supra-ecosystem">DEX benefits to you and Supra ecosystem<a href="#dex-benefits-to-you-and-supra-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DEX benefits to you and Supra ecosystem" title="Direct link to DEX benefits to you and Supra ecosystem">​</a></h3>
<p>I&#x27;ll keep this simple because it ought to be obvious and it was explained at the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better transparency, fairness and more disclosure than unregulated CEXes</li>
<li>Convenience, performance and features are <strong>very close</strong> - it&#x27;s good enough for non-professionals</li>
<li>Supra-based DEXes trade on-chain, chain earns revenue, more people buy Supra to pay for those fees</li>
<li>Supra-based DEXes need liquidity. You can stake DEX pools and make money doing that</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s also a way to distribute risk for your &quot;active&quot; Supra stash - part of your tokens that moves more often, as opposed to staked Supra that is likely quite static.
You may do something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 of active stash on a regulated CEX if you feel the need to day trade from time to time (some people prefer unregulatd; I do too, but not any of the current ones)</li>
<li>1/3 in Staking or LP Staking on Supra-based DEX number 1 (e.g. Dexlyn)</li>
<li>1/3 on Staking or LP Staking on Supra-based DEX number 2 (e.g. Atmos)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="slippage-and-fees">Slippage and fees<a href="#slippage-and-fees" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Slippage and fees" title="Direct link to Slippage and fees">​</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows Supra is fast and transaction costs are very low, Supra&#x27;s DORA (Distributed Oracles) provides up to date price feeds quickly, but one &quot;sensitive&quot; bit about DEXes is slippage and fees.</p>
<p>There isn&#x27;t enough independent detailed information available to compare, but anecodtally:</p>
<ul>
<li>A low cost, unregulated CEX may have a 0.05% &quot;taker&quot; fee (example <a href="https://www.mexc.com/fee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li>Dexlyn may have a 0.3% commission and &quot;slippage&quot; that&#x27;s to be kept at below 0.5% (default permitted slippage setting)</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is we don&#x27;t really know how it behaves (slippage). From my experience with smaller (below $1,000) amounts, Dexlyn worked fine when I compared the price from that UI with CEX prices in another browser.</p>

It&#x27;s theoretically possible. But don&#x27;t do $10K at a time if you notice at $2K it&#x27;s already higher than 0.5%!</p></div></div>
<p>For normal retail use swapping on Dexlyn right now will cost you <strong>up to 0.8%</strong> (up to 0.5% slippage plus fixed 0.3% commission). It can be below 0.5% - <strong>less</strong> than you pay at a low-cost deregulated CEX!</p>
<p>This may change for better or worse, but it&#x27;s quite simple and low-risk: don&#x27;t use a crap DEX you&#x27;ve never heard of and run small tests before ramping up like a degen! Transactions take seconds, so I&#x27;m sure you can spend 30 seconds trying with $10, $50, and $100 before you try with $500. They also have a Testnet to try with fake coins first.</p>
<p>Supra Network makes it possible to address most of those problems, so while slippage has historically been a week spot for DEXes, it&#x27;s not supposed to happen on Supra if DEXes make good use of those L1 features.</p>
<p>Now let&#x27;s see about some of the current DEXes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="dexlyn">Dexlyn<a href="#dexlyn" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dexlyn" title="Direct link to Dexlyn">​</a></h3>
<p>This one&#x27;s been in poduction since February. No bad news so far.</p>
<p>Two audits. Swapping and bridging work well for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I usually Swap Supra into dexUSDC</li>
<li>Another thing I do is I send ERC-20 USDC tokens to Dexlyn from Ethereum newtork, to fund my dexUSDC address</li>
</ul>
<p>Current disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap only (same as CEX &quot;Market Order&quot;)</li>
<li>Only SUPRA/dexUSDC (and dexUSDC is Dexlyn-wrapped ERC20 USDC)</li>
</ul>
<p>They started just last month so obviously these are temporary. They recently said they&#x27;re going to add more currency pairs and Perps, so I think major updates are coming.</p>
<p>While I&#x27;ve said Perps are bad (and that&#x27;s true) the fact is there&#x27;s demand and they&#x27;ll have to be LP-stakeds, so it&#x27;s less bad than on deregulated CEXes. Secondly, some of the LP stake will be in Supra as well, unlike on CEXes where the entire Perps system is funded with (essentialy) fake US dollars.</p>

<p>I haven&#x27;t used it on Mainnet yet, but Atmos Testnet looks very nice.</p>
<p>Unique features on their roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Down-Cost Averaging (DCA) may be delivered before Dexlyn&#x27;s since it&#x27;s already in the UI</li>
<li>Limit orders - also something that Dexyn does not have, as &quot;Swap&quot; is like &quot;Market&quot; order on CEX</li>
<li>More pairs - their Testnet currently features USDC, ETH, BTC, but I haven&#x27;t looked at how they do it</li>

<p>Solido is different. Currently also Testnet-only.</p>
<p>Their stablecoin (which Atmos on Testnet already has in its pools) is an over-collateralized synthetic USD stablecoin.</p>
<p>So yes, it&#x27;s a &quot;fake USD&quot; - like USDT, but with crypto collateral. And Supra&#x27;s DORA is used for price feeds, obviously, to figure out what&#x27;s the right exchange rates (and sufficient levels of collateral) ought to be.</p>

<p>The UI is a bit confusing, but I like the platform. It&#x27;s not a &quot;DEX&quot;, which is why they work with Atmos, but if you want to swap CIRCLE to SUPRA, or borrow CIRCLE and not (for example) USDC, it may be easier to just use Solido for everything.</p>
<p>You can borrow CIRCLE with Supra (or other) collateral, and you can do stuff with CIRCLE in Atmos or elsewhere where they accept it. Neat idea.</p>
<p>You can also stake on Solido to earn yield.</p>

<p>Everyone should make their own and DEXes could build Web tools to help users decide based on their own circumstances and requirements.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any such tool so I did this based on fixed assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEX: 50 orders a year with 100% of funds, 0.05% taker and 0% maker fee, with half of time in each category (avg. fee (0.05 + 0.00) / 2)</li>
<li>DEX: 12 orders a year with 50% of funds each time, 0.3% commission with 0.2% slippage, 50% traded and 50% staked 3/4 of time (compounding is not taken into account)</li>
<li>All trades are neutral (no profit)</li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="CEX vs DEX" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_08_cex_vs_dex_cost_comparison-b0f231ad126cb27d5bb64f1b73e9535c.png" width="417" height="437" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>The first assumption is you take it easy and trade less frequently. This may not work for some, as we already know.</p>
<p>The DEX stakingassumption is that whenever you are not trading, you can have your funds in a DEX staking pool. You can unlock some (such as 50%) or all, wait until it&#x27;s unlocked, trade, and commit funds to the pool again until next time. There are risks to staking as well, but there are less volatile pools (e.g. USDC/USDT), too. And I assumed a modest 10% APR.</p>
<p>The other two dApps aren&#x27;t on mainnet yet so I&#x27;ll use Dexlyn&#x27;s staking APR to illustrate this point: Supra/dexSDC often yields over 15%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Dexlyn Staking APR" src="/assets/images/2025-03-26_09_dex_staking-6fd521c7775135b68267458e99396b0c.png" width="1267" height="394" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>In stablecoin pools, a 10% APR isn&#x27;t rare. If you&#x27;re bullish on Supra and want to &quot;go long&quot; while minimizing the need to trade, you can now (that Supra is just 0.6 cents) stake 30% in SUPRA/dexUSDC and the rest in stablecoin pools, to get a blended APR of 11.5% and retain some exposure to potential Supra appreciation (&quot;Impermanent Gain&quot;, in DEX parlance, within the Supra-staking pool).</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if you don&#x27;t trade a lot you won&#x27;t be worse off using a DEX and these are just the <strong>direct</strong> benefits.</p>
<p>I wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with the assumptions, so here&#x27;s another version:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEX stash is idle, trade amounts are 50% of total (most regular users don&#x27;t do this, they trade 20-30% or DCA)</li>
<li>50% of DEX capital is in staking, the other 50% is fully liquid and trades</li>
</ul>

<p>DEX Trading (yellow) costs more than CEX Trading (blue), but DEX Staking (red) makes up for it and DEX comes out ahead (green).</p>
<p>Assumptions used here were only slightly different.</p>

<p>As only one half of the CEX amount is used, decline due to fees and spreads is slow. On DEX it&#x27;s higher, but even with the entire Trading stash being liquid all the time, staking gains manage to offset higher costs (fee &amp; slippage) of DEX.</p>

<p>With such optimization (especially when Supra&#x27;s AutoFi comes out, this aproach could be easy to fully automated) you could probably do weekly trades on DEX without being worse off.</p>

<p>External benefits from using DEX should help Supra price growth. I can&#x27;t think of a single downside for the Supra ecosystem if you pull most of your active stash from a CEX.</p>

<p>The current lot of unregulated exchanges that run Supra Spot market are in my opinion not good <em>hombres</em>, folks.</p>
<p>We have a solution: several in fact. Dexlyn today and two more are coming soon.</p>
<p>Move at least 50% of your active stash to DEXes, and optionally split the risk among them (for example, 50% of DEX LP funds on Dexlyn, 40% on Atmos, 10% in Solido). When you need coins to trade, unstake them. When they&#x27;re not being traded, they earn yield and strenghten the ecosystem.</p>

<p>That arrangement benefits the Supra ecosystem much more than providing CEXes with free liquidity which is mostly used to damage both holders and the token.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good for your staking, it&#x27;s good for your LPing, it&#x27;s good for the price, and so on.</p>
<p>There are virtually no downsides unless you day trade. For many it can be cheaper. I didn&#x27;t even realize that until I started writing this post.</p>
<p>It is true that some CEXes let you stake coins parked there, but none support Supra staking and and even when they do you can make more by staking on your own which in StarKey is easy.</p>
<p>Remember that this approach not only benefits your &quot;active stash&quot;, but it also benefits the Supra Network, Supra dApp creators including DEXes, and many others.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a good idea to have some Supra at a CEX. It&#x27;s a different risk profile, it&#x27;s convenient, you don&#x27;t need 20 different wallets, etc.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t recommend any particular CEX, but my own plan is to move to a <strong>regulated</strong> CEX. I didn&#x27;t expect I&#x27;d every want to do that, but now I do. After watching the current unregulated exchanges since Supra&#x27;s launch (four months now), I don&#x27;t like what I see. Unregualted CEXes could do a better job without anyone forcing them, but they prefer not to.</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm
