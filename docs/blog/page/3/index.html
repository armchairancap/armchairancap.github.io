<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Today I <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forked and published</a> a comparison of various messengers. Why?</p>
<p>Because as the author of the original comparison can&#x27;t possibly include everything (he actually checks and compares all those details, which requires non-trivial efforts) and he focuses on major messengers so Haven&#x27;t currently isn&#x27;t included. (He welcomes requests, so you could suggest Haven - Haven&#x27;t (pun intended).)</p>
<p>Not having a mobile version probably doesn&#x27;t help.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="wait-i-cant-run-haven-on-mobile">Wait, I can&#x27;t run Haven on mobile?<a href="#wait-i-cant-run-haven-on-mobile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wait, I can&#x27;t run Haven on mobile?" title="Direct link to Wait, I can&#x27;t run Haven on mobile?">​</a></h3>
<p>As of today, yes. I mean, you <em>can</em> run Haven on mobile Android and Linux devices with WASM-capable browsers, but the UI isn&#x27;t responsive and it doesn&#x27;t attempt to save battery, so it won&#x27;t be pretty.</p>
<p>xx Messenger was a mobile app that would probably have done well in a comparison, but it used an older xxDK and is no longer maintained.</p>
<p>Haven is the main reference application for xx Network confidential &amp; private messaging. There&#x27;s a patch for responsive UI which was delivered as part of Hacktoberfest 2024 activities, but it hasn&#x27;t been merged yet. Keep an eye on that in coming weeks - if merged, that would make Haven more suitable - although just the UI - for Android browsers with WASM support.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the main topic, which is I wanted to create a post with some notes regarding the Haven column in that comparison page.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="notes">Notes<a href="#notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notes" title="Direct link to Notes">​</a></h2>
<p>These are notes that clarify some of the values I picked for the Haven column in that comparison chart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="notification-if-contacts-fingerprint-changes">Notification if contact&#x27;s fingerprint changes<a href="#notification-if-contacts-fingerprint-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notification if contact&#x27;s fingerprint changes" title="Direct link to Notification if contact&#x27;s fingerprint changes">​</a></h3>
<p>Most people have tried Signal. If you swap your phone or such, your Signal chat counterparts will be informed that your &quot;fingerprint&quot; changed. There&#x27;s no such thing on cMixx (and in Haven).</p>
<p>Haven <a href="/docs/haven-user-guide/identity">identity</a> <em>is</em> the only user-facing cryptographic identity.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;&quot;change&quot; a fingerprint or anything like that. If you lose access to your identity (forget the password to encrypted identity file, or lose the identity file), you must assume a different identity. In that case there&#x27;s no mechanism for you to rejoin a private Space (1-on-1 or group chat) and message contacts saying &quot;this identity replaces this other identity&quot;. Who can tell if that&#x27;s the same person?</p>
<p>If you have backups of the invite links and pass phrases you can rejoin those spaces using the new identity. But there&#x27;s no way for others to know if the new identity is owned by the same person.</p>
<p>The only way to do this is to use the old identity to message everyone &quot;from now on, I&#x27;ll be using this new identity&quot;.</p>
<p>Another way is to use an <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/haven-user-guide/identity_external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external identity service</a> where people can look up identities you claim on xx Network. But that assumes they know your external identity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="findadd-contacts">Find/add contacts<a href="#findadd-contacts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Find/add contacts" title="Direct link to Find/add contacts">​</a></h3>
<p>See the previous point - there&#x27;s no name service in Haven, so you can&#x27;t &quot;find&quot; anyone.</p>
<p>You can use external identity services mentioned just above.</p>
<p>xx Messenger <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/idCollisionAndNotifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had this custom IDs</a>, but Haven does not. Personally I don&#x27;t miss those - I think external ID services are the way to go because messenger contacts are just one of many things you need to have an address book for.</p>
<p>Since Haven is one of few messengers that is anchored in a blockchain, knowing someone&#x27;s cMixx name is not enough. We want their wallet addresses (probably not just for xx coin, but for several currencies), their ENS name, and other public Web3 data they choose to publish.</p>
<p>Why you can&#x27;t &quot;add&quot; contacts either? Well, we&#x27;d need to sync them somewhere. xx Messenger could upload (backup) its data to S3, so contacts could be saved as well.</p>
<p>xx Haven currently doesn&#x27;t do that so contacts must be searched in external services where people publish their Haven identities. That location is a matter of choice as well - not just in terms of usability, but also privacy, cost, and more. Having to publish your data on ENS (and pay that fee) may or may not be liked by all users which is why I think Haven should leave those integrations to other cMixx messengers when they appear. I don&#x27;t mind looking it up in whatever way is convenient for me and my contacts.</p>

<p>xx Messenger used a centralized push service, but Haven doesn&#x27;t currently doesn&#x27;t have it which means it&#x27;s limited to constant polling which is power-consuming.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x27;t matter much for desktops (there&#x27;s more &quot;unnecessary&quot; activity from <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/coverTraffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cover Traffic</a> than from notifications), but matters on mobile devices.</p>

<p>The xx Foundation is a non-profit in the USA.</p>
<p>Mixnet round scheduling is done by the Foundation and that server is - if I&#x27;m not mistaken - in located the EU. The scheduling node isn&#x27;t involved in data handling.</p>
<p>Client-side ecrypted user data has five copies per each cMixx round and so user data from each conversation lives in dozens of jurisdications (see <a href="https://dashboad.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cMix dashboard</a>). The scheduling server doesn&#x27;t know which messages went into which mixnet round - only the sender and recepient(s) do, so those not included in a conversation wouldn&#x27;t even know where encrypted data is.</p>
<p>Encrypted data is kept on cMixx gateways for 21 days after which only local (cached) copies may remain on participants&#x27; clients.</p>

<p>I obviously don&#x27;t speak for the author of the original document, so the values I picked for Haven are my own.</p>
<p>This post elaborates on all the rows where I felt felt sharing some notes would be helpful. If the original author reviews and adds Haven to his document, I may or may not update my fork (I wouldn&#x27;t if I completely disagreed with this evaluation, for example).</p>

<p>Let&#x27;s see about the whys first: you need to find torrents that you want to download.</p>
<p>Tribler has internal search feature but it&#x27;s not that good yet.</p>
<p>So you go out on the Web to find torrents, which means one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being tracked on Torrent search Web sites</li>
<li>Monetary (and sometimes privacy) cost of subscribing to VPN service</li>
<li>Using Tor to hide your activity</li>
<li>Registering at Torrent sharing private Web sites or chats</li>
<li>Using some password-protected site where you&#x27;re registered with a fake or real identity</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a better way? I think there is: one UI with Haven and Tribler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone posts RSS feed into a private (or public) Haven Space (&quot;chat channel&quot;)</li>
<li>Users copy links and download them using Tribler</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="integrations">Integrations<a href="#integrations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrations" title="Direct link to Integrations">​</a></h2>
<p>Ideally, Haven could run inside of Tribler. But the Tribler project would have to make that happen. Alternatively, someone could create and maintain a patch. Not very good.</p>
<p>Another way is to create a small patch to Tribler menus and run Haven in an iFrame.</p>
<p>Another way is to run Tribler in a Haven iFrame. That&#x27;s easier, but you have to create a small patch for Haven, which some privacy-sensitive people may not like.</p>

<p>A Haven iFrame in Tribler chat menu is available <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-tribler-haven/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I call this attempt v1.0.</p>
<p>You click on the chat cloud icion and Haven opens in the main pane (iFrame).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Tribler with a Haven iFrame" src="/assets/images/tribler-with-haven-iframe-50fa42fec60a59cda3a52ce625ba3dbd.png" width="931" height="360" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: join a Haven Space (&quot;chat channel&quot;)</li>
<li>Step 2: find a magnet link</li>
<li>Step 3: paste it into &quot;Add torrent&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in</li>
</ul>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see what I mean? If your use case is &quot;get into a Haven Space, get one link, copy it to Tribler and leave Haven&quot;, this is actually a good approach. All it takes to secure access to Haven is to navigate away: you won&#x27;t leave Haven iFrame open because in order to use that Magnet link you&#x27;ll have to leave it. Just make sure your Haven profile password is strong!</p>
<p>Note that this only hides your Haven identity, Spaces, and chat data, while Tribler UI is still running and downloaded data is on disk.</p>
<p>The second approach I tried - a Tribler iFrame in Haven - works the other way around, except there&#x27;s no state in Tribler (it&#x27;s a server-based application with a Web UI) so if you download multiple torrents or like to chat with Space members as you download, this may be better for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Haven with a Tribler iFrame" src="/assets/images/haven-with-tribler-iframe-c8ad47f0ddb017cf455472d09dd1c2fd.png" width="1544" height="654" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Join a channel, get your links, download them in Tribler and watch/manage downloads as they go.</p>
<p>In this approach there&#x27;s a small patch to Haven which seems low-risk to me if you&#x27;re the only user of your Haven instance: you own the Haven instance and you own the Tribler instance as well, so as long as you&#x27;re not concerned about Tribler in a Haven iFrame, I think patching Haven and using it this way is fine.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m working on finalizing these small patches in another release at the same location as v1.0.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="do-we-actually-need-any-integration">Do we actually need any integration?<a href="#do-we-actually-need-any-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do we actually need any integration?" title="Direct link to Do we actually need any integration?">​</a></h3>
<p>That&#x27;s a good question. If you don&#x27;t use both of these applications at the same time often, it&#x27;s probably best to use them separately and avoid complications.</p>
<p>As an example of yet other approaches, I&#x27;ve built a simple browser extension which downloads selected (Magnet) links using Tribler: very easy to use, no patches required. But you can&#x27;t see or control what&#x27;s going on with downloads without going to another tab or window with Tribler UI.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t load Haven in this &quot;preview&quot; version of Firefox (WASM issues), but this is how simple the extension is: select a Magnet link in Haven chat and use the extension to initiate Tribler download.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Download with Tribler Extension" src="/assets/images/haven-with-browser-extension-2d8b862c5e70c1b64e4d73c74ac38513.png" width="1317" height="757" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This can work anywhere including the &quot;Haven with a Tribler iFrame&quot; approach because it simply talks to the Tribler API and Tribler UI doesn&#x27;t need to be visible. It saves some copy-and-paste even if Tribler runs in the same browser tab as Haven. I&#x27;ve posted a proof-of-concept version <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/magnet-link-downloader-tribler-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> - see the link for the details.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re a security freak, I won&#x27;t try to persuade you to use these iFrame approaches.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="security-concerns">Security concerns<a href="#security-concerns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security concerns" title="Direct link to Security concerns">​</a></h2>
<p>It is possible that the app in iFrame does something to its parent frame. If you worry about that, of course just run the apps separately or even in different VMs.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Haven with a Tribler iFrame&quot; approach we could tighten the iFrame CORS, and also properly integrate applications so that we don&#x27;t have to skip authentication from <code>localhost</code> clients on Tribler (which I currently do). I&#x27;ll post the patches in the repo for easy reviewing. Risk of someone else accessing your instance of Tribler on <code>localhost</code> (where Haven is running) through Haven iFrame should be extremely low, though.</p>
<p>And this instance of Tribler should not listen on public IPs - simply close off its Web UI and IP ports.</p>
<p>If you want to let others access Haven on the same computer, you could simply start another container binding a public IP and port. The same goes for extra Tribler instances.</p>
<p>In a crazy mix-up setup you could run a &quot;groupware edition&quot; of Haven-Tribler compose.yaml:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haven-Tribler setup for multiple users (who all share same Tribler and can be in the same channel if they&#x27;re all focused on same content)</li>
<li>One Web server gateway sharing static content (Tribler download directory) for authenticated downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>That would be as secure as the stupidest downloader.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2>
<p>Haven provides private and confidential access to Magnet links that can be used in Tribler: free access, post-quantum E2EE, and metadata shredding eliminate the need to use Tor, VPNs or privacy-leaking Web sites.</p>
<p>Among DIY approaches at lightweight integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>For single-torrent and one-off use, Tribler with a Haven iFrame is a good approach which forces inconvenience (and results in good SecOps)</li>
<li>For parallel use (Haven + Tribler) and multiple downloads, I like Haven with a Tribler iFrame because it gives me full control over Tribler</li>
<li>For &quot;hidden Tribler&quot; we can run Haven + browser extension that hooks into the Tribler API, but you&#x27;d want extra controls and visibility into downloads, which means either occasional access to Tribler UI or a fat extension with some Tribler indicators similar to &quot;Down Them All&quot; or such (which is complex).</li>

<p>I added it to a fork <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/bip_utils_xx/commit/6b15ab0d26aa8a75238a1047336e82e1549c79bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You could make similar/same modifications to bip-utils and build it yourself, of course.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d have to submit a patch to upstream, but &quot;generic&quot; Substrate coins are supported as well, so you could use it the same way without &quot;hardcoded&quot; XX configuration in bip-utils. You&#x27;d need to specify a custom coin/chain configuration, though. In the fork, that&#x27;s already done.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s not A vs. B, it&#x27;s A and B, but the Nym Web sites make some biased comparisons with xx Network, so I&#x27;ll do my own for the benefit of my readers.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-are-nym-and-xx-network">What are Nym and xx Network?<a href="#what-are-nym-and-xx-network" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are Nym and xx Network?" title="Direct link to What are Nym and xx Network?">​</a></h2>
<p>They&#x27;re both blockchain-rooted privacy platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nym Tech <a href="https://nymtech.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> (they have different sites for the company, services, etc.)</li>
<li>xx Network <a href="https://xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web site</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But there are differences, so let&#x27;s take a look at those.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="comparison">Comparison<a href="#comparison" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comparison" title="Direct link to Comparison">​</a></h2>
<p>This is how I see it.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Nym</th><th>xx Network</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blockchain</td><td>Cosmos SDK-based</td><td>Polkadot SDK-based (Substrate)</td></tr><tr><td>Validators</td><td>Permissioned validators</td><td>Permissionless validators</td></tr><tr><td>Services</td><td>VPN and mixnet service</td><td>Mixnet service</td></tr><tr><td>Payments</td><td>Zk-nyms</td><td>No anonymity</td></tr><tr><td>Mixnet</td><td>modified 3rd party (Loopix)</td><td>Self-developed, PQC (cMix)</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy coin</td><td>Semi-privacy coin (Nym)</td><td>Non-privacy coin (xx coin)</td></tr><tr><td>PQC</td><td>No (roadmap item)</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I haven&#x27;t compared VPN-related features because xx Network doesn&#x27;t offer that service. You may want to do your own comparison vs. Mullvad VPN or other VPN service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="blockchain">Blockchain<a href="#blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blockchain" title="Direct link to Blockchain">​</a></h3>
<p>This isn&#x27;t important for end users, but Polkadot (used by xx Network) has a bigger ecosystem compared to Cosmos.</p>
<p>Governance and integrations seem better on Polkadot and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s been relatively easy for xx Network to create integrations (bridge) with Ripple and Ethereum, for example. I expect this will continue simply because xx Network leverages a superior blockchain platform (Polkadot).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="validators">Validators<a href="#validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Validators" title="Direct link to Validators">​</a></h3>
<p>Nym is still running a permissioned network that&#x27;s smaller than xx Network&#x27;s. In this regard, they&#x27;re behind.</p>
<p>Perhaps out of necessity, Nym has a more restricted entry and exit conditions for validators. I actually like how they do this and I think it&#x27;s better than xx Network. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New validators can join via a NYM-to-NYX swap contract. The contract will not allow more than 1% of total stake increase per month to prevent sudden hostile takeovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The contract will only allow swapping NYM to NYX and will not allow exchanging NYX back to NYM. A NYX holder who wishes to sell their NYX stake will have to do so via OTC trades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may say this doesn&#x27;t prevent indirect hoarding of coins, but at least at this moment (because the network is permissioned with KYC, it appears) they can control this better. xx Network has some small pools that should be banned from the network, but the problem probably isn&#x27;t significant enough to motivate the community to move against it.</p>
<p>xx Network is permissionless as far as staking and identity are concerned. So, although Nym&#x27;s rules and controls seem helpful, they may not be possible to implement on xx Network or a permissionless Nym network. We&#x27;ll see how Nym adjusts to permissionless life (if they ever get there).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="services">Services<a href="#services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Services" title="Direct link to Services">​</a></h3>
<p>Nym provides a Wireguard-based VPN routed over their network, which xx Network doesn&#x27;t do.</p>
<p>While this seems great - you don&#x27;t need to buy Mullvad or other VPN subscription, for example - it&#x27;s a trap.</p>
<p>Not for the users, but for Nym Tech and their community whose nodes provide that service.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be able to pull this off because bandwidth requirements will be huge and there&#x27;s no way operators who operate VPN entry/exit nodes can do that with residential connections. What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means SPs or the cloud, and that means they&#x27;ll need to be paid.</p>
<p>But, now you have KYC + getting paid for VPN + risk of illegal use (which they can&#x27;t really monitor because it&#x27;s encrypted and censorship-free). Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>Do you want to make $500/mo and deal with daily DMCA notices and maybe even police inquiries? Not many people do, unless they&#x27;re based in a 3rd world country.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to pull that off. If I was them I&#x27;d allow only whitelisted destinations, but for most of those people don&#x27;t really need to use VPNs.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m skeptical.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="integrations">Integrations<a href="#integrations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrations" title="Direct link to Integrations">​</a></h3>
<p>I haven&#x27;t done a deep dive on these, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nym is ahead in VPN-related integrations simply because there&#x27;s not much to integrate and xx Network doesn&#x27;t have that integration to begin with</li>
<li>Mixnet integrations are hard to compare because they&#x27;re dissimilar and each platform has a few so maybe it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s roughly even</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Network has wallet integrations through Proxxy (cMix-backed API proxy), while Nym&#x27;s own wallet natively uses Nym&#x27;s mixnet (and they have Zk-nyms), so in wallet integrations they&#x27;re likely better.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="payments">Payments<a href="#payments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Payments" title="Direct link to Payments">​</a></h3>
<p>xx Network doesn&#x27;t have blockchain privacy features. This decision was deliberate - I wrote about it <a href="/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nym has zk-nyms which makes it a privacy-capable coin and therefore a candidate for delisting (or harder listing) on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>If you need a VPN, you can get Mullvad VPN and pay with Monero. If you&#x27;re a Nym VPN user, then it appears you can buy Nym VPN credits with Zcash.</p>
<p>Both approaches work, but with Nym you can buy both VPN and pay for mixnet services with one coin. Now you may say &quot;I prefer Monero and Mullvad&quot;, but that&#x27;s a matter of preference and convenience.</p>
<p>xx coin, the native currency of xx chain, may add privacy features in the future but it&#x27;s been de-prioritized to avoid regulatory and listing challenges.</p>
<p>One valid point in Nym&#x27;s material is that you can acquire their coin and pay for services without being tracked. xx Network can&#x27;t do that. At the same time, xx Network cMix service is still free, so there&#x27;s nothing to pay for. You still <em>don&#x27;t need</em> any xx coin to use xx Network in the first place!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="mixnet">Mixnet<a href="#mixnet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mixnet" title="Direct link to Mixnet">​</a></h3>
<p>First, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a to-do item for Nym, and implemented in xx Network&#x27;s cMix.</p>
<p>Second, Nym&#x27;s network is still centralized, so every single validator is known. Said differently: Nym mixing is decentralized, but all the mixers are known.</p>
<p>Third, in their <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litepaper</a>, they have a comparison between cMix (mixnet used by xx Network) and their modified 3rd party design (based on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-piotrowska.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loopix</a>). I&#x27;m not qualified to evaluate that, so I won&#x27;t.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s this thing below. As a reminder: their litepaper was published (updated?) in 2023, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve missed anything because it didn&#x27;t exist in mid 2023.</p>
<p>In the table below they refer to Elixxir (which was the company behind xx Network/cMix early on) although xx Network has become foundation-managed years ago and Elixxir no long plays a role. Maybe using a prehistoric name is a way to say &quot;we created that in 2019 and forgot to update&quot;. Well, you didn&#x27;t and your litepaper was published on Nov 2, 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2024-08-20-nym-vs-cmix-883252249a85e0a74143c500e753cffb.png" width="685" height="448" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 - Incentivised relays</strong> - xx Network has had that for years. Validators stake themselves and get staked by other coin holders. They get rewarded for authoring blocks on xx chain and relaying cMix messages. <a href="/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage/">In coming quarters</a> postage for premium tier users.</li>
<li><strong>2 - Scalable network</strong> - xx Network has almost 400 nodes - more than enough for its traffic needs - and it doesn&#x27;t seem not scalable (or whatever is the opposite from scalable). For a mixnet focused on short messages (whether it&#x27;s text messages or API calls), it seems scalable enough to me.</li>
<li><strong>3 - Secure and efficient encryption protocol</strong> - As I&#x27;ve mentioned earlier Nym claims their approach has a higher efficiency which I am unable to judge, but they don&#x27;t have post-quantum encryption so even it it&#x27;s more efficient, is it more secure across the board? It&#x27;s a blanket statement. Not to mention that xx Network&#x27;s cMix was developed in-house by Dr. Chaum and is still being developed (this includes development for <a href="/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage">three Worldcoin grants</a>), while Nym&#x27;s is a modified implementation of a 3rd party invention.</li>
<li><strong>4 - Community governance of the relay nodes</strong> - xx Network has had this for years and Polkadot has better governance features than Cosmos.</li>
<li><strong>5 - Large anonymity set</strong> - xx Network currently uses 5 nodes and most messages generally delivered within 3 seconds (see Real Time (round) component in the <a href="https://dashboard.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network dashboard</a> - mean 24h latency is currently 2.12s). That seems enough for the use cases targeted by xx Network (chat, API proxy, voting, etc.), and can be increased. I don&#x27;t know how large (it&#x27;s not in the litepaper and I didn&#x27;t try very hard to find that information elsewhere) Nym&#x27;s anonymity sets are, so this advantage isn&#x27;t quantified and doesn&#x27;t appear significant for xx Network use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Nym has some advantages, but they&#x27;re behind in terms of development - fully permissioned chain, no PQC and with legal challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>VPNs are cool, but it&#x27;s also just bulk traffic - porn, Torrents and crap of that nature. Not that we don&#x27;t need that too, but it&#x27;s a saturated and legally sensitive market (copyright violations, illegal content, etc). Due to the high cost of comparatively enormous bandwidth required for VPNs, it will be a very tough use case to monetize. And Nym Tech has bills to pay.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaum&#x27;s decisions to not create a privacy coin and to focus on specific (and high-value) use cases such as messaging and voting were in hindsight perfect. The choice of blockchain platform (Polkadot/Substrate) - whether due to luck or wisdom or a combination of both - also seems better than Nym&#x27;s Cosmos, so I expect less hurdles and faster progress with xx Network&#x27;s Web3 integrations.</p>
<p>Personally I&#x27;m comfortable with design choices, target markets and other details of xx Network.</p>
<p>Nym looks like a decent platform, but they&#x27;ve made some less than ideal choices.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_i4In padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/xx-network">xx network</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_RyL6"><a href="/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage">Worldcoin and xx Network postage</a></h2><div class="container_d2a9 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z">August 16, 2024</time> · <!-- -->11 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_tJ1H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/armchairancap.png" alt="ArmchairAncap"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ArmchairAncap</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> this is not investment advice.

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>xx Network has been around for years and has users, but not very many because:</p>
<ul>
<li>many Web3 and coin projects suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome (<a href="http://localhost:3000/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>)</li>
<li>many projects don&#x27;t know about xx Network</li>
<li>several smart projects know and appreciate xx Network but they&#x27;re are still in the process of integrating with xx Network (or the other way around)</li>
</ul>
<p>Worldcoin is one of those smart projects in &quot;the other way around&quot; situation - xx Network is creating integrations for Worldcoin and this is work in progress (and progressing well).</p>
<p>Specifically, there are three Worldcoin Foundation grants that were awarded to xx Network-affiliated developers. You can read or listen about it in this interesting interview with <a href="https://patcrypt.com/worldcoin-xx-network-collaboration-interview-with-mario-yaksetig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the developers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Worldcoin is doing their thing. Today I saw <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-mimos-partnership-bring-digital-proof-humanness-malaysia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MIMOS Berhad, the applied research and development arm of the Malaysian Government, has signed an MoU with the Worldcoin Foundation, Tools for Humanity (TFH) and MyEG, a leading e-government services provider, to integrate Worldcoin technology into the country’s digital infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The intent of the MoU is to leverage the Worldcoin protocol and TFH technologies to improve ongoing and future work related to digital credentials. In doing so, it validates the importance of digital proof of humanness in the age of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, wait, how many people live in Malaysia? 34 million.</p>
<p>Whoa - xx coin will go to the moon!!!</p>
<p>No, it won&#x27;t. But fine - let&#x27;s talk about postage!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="postage">Postage<a href="#postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postage" title="Direct link to Postage">​</a></h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve blogged about &quot;postage&quot;, which is how xx Network plans to charge for its Premium tier suitable for power users.</p>
<p>Where will the collected postage go? Mostly to the validators - server operators on xx Network - and (if I recall correctly) part of it goes to the xx Foundation.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the price of xx coin will moon? Of course not.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know if those Worldcoin apps in Malaysia will actually be released. It&#x27;s just an MoU.</p>
<p>Even if they make it, we don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll <em>choose</em> to use Worldcoin&#x27;s privacy features that rely on xx Network. The Malaysian integrators <em>could</em> choose to not use them at all and I&#x27;d say this may be the most likely outcome in this particular country.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know how many apps will be developed, and how frequently they&#x27;ll be used.</p>
<p>We also don&#x27;t know if the apps will <em>need</em> access to Premium tier. Each individual user probably won&#x27;t need it and postage measures access by each individual user. An app can have 5 million users and as long as each sends or receives several messages per minute, none of them will need to pay postage.</p>
<p>Are the chances of Worldcoin apps using xx Network&#x27;s Premium tier nil, then?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="why-pay-postage">Why pay postage<a href="#why-pay-postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why pay postage" title="Direct link to Why pay postage">​</a></h2>
<p>While only a very small percentage of Worldcoin (or other platform&#x27;s) users will require access to Premium (or &quot;unlimited&quot; aka &quot;best effort&quot;) tier, anyone who charges for their application or service or wants to prevent <em>another</em> paying user (or all the free users) from hogging them out, may want to ask users to subscribe to the Premium tier if it&#x27;s affordable enough.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not making this up to spread the idea that massive demand for xx coin is inevitable or just around the corner.</p>
<p>What I&#x27;m saying is I expect postage will be inexpensive enough to be purchased for &quot;just in case&quot; situations.</p>
<p>When you think about it, that&#x27;s almost the opposite from &quot;xx coin will moon&quot; - the idea here isn&#x27;t to create scarcity and get rich off the appreciating xx coin. On the contrary!</p>
<p>The way markets work is: if you want more of something, you pay for it just enough to make the seller willing to satisfy that demand.</p>
<p>If xx Network&#x27;s message mixing service (cMix) works well for you, there&#x27;s no &quot;reason&quot; to pay anything. (But you have the option to donate to the Foundation if so inclined).</p>
<p>But the presence of a Free Tier also means that everyone gets the same rights.</p>
<p>Someone can stand up 500 containers in AWS and spam the network all day long just because. Or simply try to freeload as much as possible.</p>
<p>If this happens at scale, quality of service as experienced by Free tier users may be impacted.</p>
<p>If you are getting paid for the app you sell or rely on xx Network at scale, then it may be wise to avoid such congestions where a busy day for Free tier users translates into a busy day for your Support staff. It&#x27;s better to pay some postage just in case of accidental or malicious congestions.</p>
<p>As users pay for Postage, decentralized nodes that participate on the network (&quot;validators&quot;) earn more xx coins which means more nodes can come online without diluting any node&#x27;s daily earnings and at the same time improves network throughput.</p>
<p>Demand for xx coin may result in its price going up, but I would not expect significant impacts from demand for postage because as long as <em>similar</em> services exist, no one will pay 3x premium for xx Network. They may pay a 10% or even 110% more, but not for very long.</p>
<p>In addition to this &quot;just in case I need it&quot; scenario, there may be high volume users who prefer to use Premium tier on a regular basis.</p>
<p>A power user who sends thousands of messages every day (example: IoT feed or remote camera that chunks images into many &quot;text&quot; messages) could set up multiple identities to stay within the Free tier limit, or make his life simpler and pay a small premium for 1-2 thousand messages above the cut-off message limit for the Premium tier.</p>
<p>How will postage work? You may view a draft of high-level design for v1.0 features <a href="https://patcrypt.com/plans-for-postage-v1-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see in that document, users will also be throttled per smaller units of time, so that no one can overload the network by exhausting their daily quota within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>We can also see that in v1.0 there will be no &quot;reserved capacity&quot; which some users would probably like to have. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elections: with 5 million voters and (only) 3 hours to vote, you may want to prepay for 600 messages per second during voting hours on the election day. xx Network would then lower its Free tier throughput from (let&#x27;s say) 7 to 5 messages per client per minute and drop total Free tier throughput per second by 600 messages per second. But this isn&#x27;t easy. We may need smart contracts (to reserve time) which Polkadot SDK has, but xx Network hasn&#x27;t yet activated on its Substrate-based xx chain. And there&#x27;s another problem: speculators could front-run legitimate buyers as election dates are known in advance and often hard-coded in legislative acts</li>
<li>Any user with &quot;guaranteed minimum&quot; requirements. Even if you need to send just 1 message per minute (which well within the Free tier - there&#x27;s 1,440 minutes in a day) - you may want to pay postage in order to able to send at least one message per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>When you consider all these niche scenarios, it&#x27;s easy to see how this gets complicated quickly. I&#x27;ve no idea what&#x27;s the best way to go about it in Postage v2 or later, but for thousands of users with custom requirements, Smart Contracts maybe the way to go as all mixing nodes can easily look them up on xx chain.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="node-operators-and-permissionless-postage">Node operators and permissionless postage<a href="#node-operators-and-permissionless-postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Node operators and permissionless postage" title="Direct link to Node operators and permissionless postage">​</a></h2>
<p>If you need guaranteed throughput for your clients, you can strike a deal whereby an operator gives you a dedicated, guaranteed fraction of their node&#x27;s connections. You&#x27;d have to approach them on xx Network Discord and so on, but in theory that&#x27;s possible.</p>
<p>No one needs to know, you get guaranteed throughput when everyone else may be timing out while connecting to xx Network gateways. Can that be done?</p>
<p>Not for very many messages and users, but it&#x27;s certainly viable for either Free or Premium tiers. I can reserve 10kB/s for your client IP or throttle everyone else but your IP, for example.</p>
<p>Any node operator could make such side deals on their own for users <em>who don&#x27;t mind to always connect to the same gateways</em>. That decreases user&#x27;s privacy, so that&#x27;s a trade-off which may or may not matter.</p>
<p>Another trade-off is if the network is overloaded, that node may be able to accept your messages just fine, but still unable to complete mixing them with other (random) groups of nodes out there, so it&#x27;s not guaranteed to work in terms of actually sending messages.</p>
<p>I conclude this would be possible but not very valuable for either the node operators (&quot;validators&quot;) or users. The Premium Tier is expected to be cheap enough to make these laborious workarounds unnecessary and unattractive financially, technically, and privacy-wise.</p>
<p>One use case for this may be local elections, where the government stands up 3-4 nodes and limits access to in-country IPs. As noted above that would impact - maybe even compromise (I&#x27;m not qualified to tell) - privacy, but not the integrity of messages (protected by PQC), but it would also make DDoS attacks on that day much harder to execute - any in-country IP addresses could be shut down in minutes, while foreign IP addresses wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to connect to those gateway nodes. I can&#x27;t estimate the impact of this approach so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but there may be similar use cases where having your own node on the network could be beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final thoughts" title="Direct link to Final thoughts">​</a></h2>
<p>I don&#x27;t expect Worldcoin&#x27;s integrations in Malaysia will result in much demand on xx Network <em>when</em> postage becomes available. For Malaysia, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the government mandated that all Worldcoin-integrated apps include various gov-mandated data gathering add-ons.</p>
<p>But what excites me is that similar integrations will sooner or later happen in some other country. A Worldcoin-integrating app developer <em>may</em> also choose to enable xxNetwork-related privacy features. If that sounds unlikely to you, please see the interview with Mario and the voting integration (one of the three grants). Even Malaysia may want to enable anonymity in a Worldcoin voting app and disable it in other domestic Worldcoin applications.</p>
<p>Postage v1.0 may not be able to satisfy all use cases right away. DoS-style attacks by sock-puppet accounts could cause issues even to users of the Premium tier, but xx Network has world-class developers who are no doubt aware of all these things and will make recommendations related to privacy, security, performance and reliability expectations.</p>
<p>Postage v1.0 may become available a few months from now and it is one of the features essential for monetization of xx Network&#x27;s mixing services.</p>
<p>Other apps rely on donations, subscriptions, or may be VC-backed and don&#x27;t need to charge just yet.</p>
<p>xx Network is integrated with a blockchain service and very unique in that regard. Rewards - and later postage - are sent and received on a blockchain. For messaging, servers that pass and mix messages are operated by individuals from many countries and they&#x27;re currently rewarded for their &quot;mixing&quot;, but there&#x27;s only a free tier so rewards aren&#x27;t as impactful and demand for coins is lower because there aren&#x27;t real life use cases for it. Postage will improve and better align users&#x27; and operators&#x27; incentives.</p>
<p>My take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worldcoin in Malaysia won&#x27;t make xx coin &quot;go to the moon&quot;</li>
<li>Benefits of xx Network integrations with Worldcoin are real. Potential for adoption is real. When the first integrated implementation happens xx Network traffic could see a significant increase</li>
<li>All other apps that use xx Network as &quot;transport&quot; could use Premium tier, but currently Worldcoin seems to be the most significant integration.</li>
<li>Postage won&#x27;t make xx Network expensive to use. It will make xx Network deliver more value</li>
<li>Until there&#x27;s a way to <em>reserve</em> throughput, apps with high reliability expectations should have a way to fallback to Tor or direct access when uptime is more precious than privacy</li>

<p>I&#x27;m not a cryptography expert, so all I can do is rehash information from trusted sources (and you may verify it if you wish).</p>
<p>What value does rehashing content that I myself can&#x27;t verify add? Usually not much (so I don&#x27;t do it) but:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one improves discoverability</li>
<li>It curates some information that I find valuable</li>

<p>So the news - to me - is that xx Network client switched to CTIDH. I didn&#x27;t know that until today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[xx Network client] switched to CTIDH after a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vulnerability</a> was found for SIDH. Users interested in PQ messaging should use this branch.</p>

<p>Where can people find easy-to-digest information about CTIDH? Go <a href="https://ctidh.isogeny.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>What cryptographic primitives does xx Network client use? Current list from <a href="https://git.xx.network/elixxir/docs/-/commits/master/end_to_end.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the edited page</a> that still mentions SIDH s:</p>
<ul>
<li>XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.</li>
<li>Blake2b: Length is 256 bits. Used as part of key generation, key expansion, identity generation, and identification codes. Used to combine Diffie–Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.</li>
<li>HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.</li>
<li>Diffie–Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the page still mentions SIDH for PQ and below that is a note that it was replaced by CTIDH is below it. This is so that if you have a client with an older build, you know that you should use a newer client if you care about latest PQ encryption.</p>

<p>They didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>xx Network picked SIDH at the time it was <em>not</em> known to be vulnerable and they did it because it was evaluated and found to be suitable.</p>
<p>One reason particularly stands out to me because it alone - given that SIDH used to be recommended by experts in the field - made it very desirable for use in PQ private messaging.</p>

<p>the primary reason is the key sizes as they fit into a single packet</p>

<p>It came out early and it used xx Network in a way that&#x27;s not efficient by current xx Network standards (now the recommended way is <a href="https://git.xx.network/elixxir/xxdk-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xxDK</a>).</p>
<p>As direction of development changed towards a less generic, more Web3-oriented applications, xx Messenger wasn&#x27;t updated, but it was still considered not at risk and it wasn&#x27;t promoted either. It would have needed total overhaul (front-end for Web3, back-end for xxDK) and while the source code is still available, the application itself was pulled (or allowed to expire, I&#x27;m not sure) on iOS. I haven&#x27;t checked for Android.</p>

<p>Last February I head over there, register and, in a topic related to Wickr alternatives, mention <strong>two</strong> applications that use xx Network&#x27;s cMix (not just xx Messenger):</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakeasy/Haven - as a modern (xxDK mentioned above) version but not yet for mobile</li>
<li>xx Messenger - as a mobile app that (at the time) was still available on iOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I&#x27;m following xx Network closely, I <em>know</em> that xx Messenger isn&#x27;t maintained, I know <em>why</em> (for the reasons explained above), so I mention that Phoenixx.io plans to launch a modern mobile messenger and that Speakeasy may also become available for mobile.</p>
<p>But, in one comment I make a mistake and cite that false statement by the Signal CEO and also say that Signal <em>has</em> metadata that has been disclosed to law enforcement and assist in identifying users (not the content of Signal messages). A minor mistake - which I admitted and rephrased - was that I said that Signal had in the past disclosed users&#x27; IP addresses, but of course they wouldn&#x27;t do that as law enforcement comes to them asking about the use of Signal (they likely already have users&#x27; IP address). I stick to the statement that metadata had been disclosed and that IP addresses <em>could</em> be as well.</p>
<p>Members and the owner respond with dismissive comments, insults, accusations and foul language.</p>
<p>Guy nicknamed TechFounder <a href="https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=site%3adiscuss.techlore.tech+%22xx+network%22&amp;d=4678435270362092&amp;mkt=en-WW&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=CQQ_JiUp0zhPgYEILFIgyomLftTED_lL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes first</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where’s their Post-Quantum encryption documentation? Has it been auditied (sic!)/proven it actually protects against those attacks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gee, indeed, where could it be possibly found? Maybe by searching the Internet for &#x27;xx Network&#x27; or &#x27;xx Messenger&#x27;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You didn’t provide anything useful for anyone, just for your ego saying that your obscure messenger it’s better than Signal when it clearly isn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that&#x27;s what triggered them: I pointed out that the big news about Signal being the first with PQ was really a piece of fake news since xx Messenger (and possibly other) PQ messengers have been out there for a while. I did <em>not</em> claim xx Messenger was better at all.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t say Signal was the first <em>major</em> PQ messenger and it wasn&#x27;t on X/Twitter - her statement was posted on Mastodon - so she wasn&#x27;t limited by the maximum number of characters per post so that she couldn&#x27;t qualify her statement. To me, that&#x27;s a problem and simply pointing that out ought to be useful to the community because it says something about the person who runs that shop. Not that she&#x27;s compromised or anything that bad, but if you can&#x27;t trust 100% of what a person says, it may be the time to start scrutinizing every word that comes out of their mouth.</p>
<p>One may say it&#x27;s an innocent mistake despite not being limited by word count on X - one word less or more, what&#x27;s the big deal? She&#x27;s not a semi-literate, misspelling computer geek familiar with only computer languages. She <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker#Early_life_and_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knows better</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whittaker completed her bachelor&#x27;s <strong>degree in rhetoric</strong> at University of California, Berkeley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or maybe she was indeed precise and accurately stated that Signal was the first to add PQ encryption to Signal. xx Network was the first to add it to xx Messenger. Everyone is right!!!</p>
<p>And what about TechFounder&#x27;s obscurity comment? Of course, what can possibly be more obscure to people actively engaged in cryptography and privacy than work of Dr. Chaum?</p>
<p>But not everyone at Techlore.tech is incompetent and dismissive. Another user - Karner - obviously performed due diligence. Their expert opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re referring to an obscure blockchain-based scam-based messaging platform that has no users and uses a broken cryptosystem (SIDH)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right, I&#x27;m promoting scams which I guess makes me a scammer (or a useful idiot at best). That&#x27;s a promising line of attack against my claim that xx Messenger was PQ before Signal!</p>
<p>Never mind that I didn&#x27;t even mention xx coin. But now that I am blogging on my personal blog everyone can check my X posts (tweets) and blog posts here and easily find dozens of occurrences where I encouraged and invited people to &quot;invest&quot; in xx coin and all the claims it&#x27;s going to moon. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Also never mind that although SIDH - one of the pieces in that stack - was found to be vulnerable, xx developers estimated cMix was still fine.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://discuss./t/wickr-messaging-is-no-longer-available-as-of-31-12-2023/6576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThiccRaiden</a> (claims to accept any pronouns in his/her/their profile - must be very nice, I thought) says to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You join the forum, literally make shit up and then backpedal to ‘well it’s hypothetically possible,’ while promoting a random messaging app</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The stuff I &quot;made up&quot; was the IP misstatement mentioned earlier, which I rephrased and which didn&#x27;t impact the validity of my claim about Signal&#x27;s access to that metadata - they may not <em>retain</em> it, but they do have it, as does AWS.)</p>
<p>I respond to ThiccRaiden&#x27;s rude message by saying that I don&#x27;t care about the rudeness, but I won&#x27;t respond in kind and if the site owner moderates, they should apply the same rules to all members.</p>
<p>By now I&#x27;ve been called a scammer, poster of useless information (spammer?), and liar. What a hearty, warm welcome!</p>
<p>The site owner completely ignores all that and doubles down on ThiccRaiden&#x27;s message of ignorance and FUD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Android App hasn’t been updated since August of 2022. Not touching this with a 50ft pole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#x27;s unpack that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is obscure</strong>. False. It wasn&#x27;t a Tier 1 - let&#x27;s say it wasn&#x27;t even Tier 2 - messaging application, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. It was very likely the first PQ messenger, by early 2024 it was out there with PQ for years before other &quot;alternatives to Wickr&quot;, cMix that it uses was created by some of the top people in the field and we know it wasn&#x27;t obscure because the app had many downloads. Not only are/were there cMix messaging apps in ongoing development, but application interfaces are being implemented for &quot;application messages&quot; from other projects as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saying that Signal has users&#x27; identifiable metadata is &quot;making shit up&quot;</strong>. Is that true? Yes. Signal operates Signal gateways. We know they have at least some MD on (date of user&#x27;s last use).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may have seen this slide which says that Signal can provide &quot;last date of a user&#x27;s connectivity to the service&quot;.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Signal and user metadata" src="/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-7c494b2cfddc58255c520bbd6084ff2b.png" width="1431" height="635" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saying that it&#x27;s hypothetically possible is back-pedalling</strong>. It&#x27;s not just &quot;hypothetically&quot; possible, it&#x27;s simply &quot;pending a search warrant&quot;. It&#x27;s not even Signal that owns Signal gateway nodes - it&#x27;s the freaking AWS!</li>
</ul>
<p>If law enforcement delivers a search warrant to Signal, Signal gives what they have and law enforcement finds you used Signal yesterday. Then they also find that among 15 suspected friends of yours only one has also used Signal yesterday - how hard is it to guess which of the 15 may be the guy you used Signal to communicate with?</p>
<p>If Signal retains only &quot;date&quot; (no hour, no second), could AWS be asked to provide their firewall logs to help LE narrow that down a bit? Yes, but only theoretically, so don&#x27;t worry about it!</p>
<p>Oh, no, they in fact do provide more than just a &quot;date&quot;. Oops!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Signal metadata in response to search warrant" src="/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-response-to-search-warrant-183fcac74c9a0a5887be2286702b96f2.png" width="638" height="249" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Millisecond precision. That&#x27;s <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from here</a>.</p>
<p>How about this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>LE asks Signal for a timestamp and gets it with millisecond precision</li>
<li>LE asks AWS to give list of IPs accessing Signal gateways through AWS firewall during a 200 millisecond interval surrounding the timestamp provided by Signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that only theoretical? How many IP addresses would AWS return? 50? How many from a small country? I&#x27;d say just one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger hasn&#x27;t been touched in a year</strong>. I know that, I know why, and that&#x27;s why in my original message I said that and also gave links for Speakeasy/Haven and the Phoenixx app (at the time called Echoexx and available for alpha testing). But why not ignore all that and make a completely biased and ignorant comment (not that I care, but they purportedly do, being big on education and stuff).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is vulnerable</strong> (I don&#x27;t have the exact wording). When I mentioned xx Network&#x27;s PQ encryption, they laser-focused on trashing xx Network because of SIDH and completely ignored that I showed that the Signal CEO in fact lied when she said they came up with PQ first, and that SIDH was not vulnerable when xx Messenger adopted it. Now that SIDH has been replaced CTIDH, I wanted to reflect on that thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is a scam</strong>. This is hilarious. xx Messenger wasn&#x27;t a blockchain-based app, it couldn&#x27;t connect to any blockchain whatsoever, and even to this day xx Network&#x27;s cMix is free for use. You don&#x27;t need any coins, I even <a href="/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important">blogged about that here</a>. But there&#x27;s also a subtler, Signal-related point that I want to make at the bottom of this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of their comments are still online:</p>

<p>Nice people, right? Well, <a href="https://www.techlore.tech/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they say this about themselves</a>:</p>

<p>When you see &quot;don&#x27;t make shit up&quot; in response to your civil and on-point comment, you know you&#x27;re being educated!</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a trap!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Warm welcome by Karner" src="/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-abuse-02-d50129d473697a87d16cf24e3469b70a.png" width="737" height="158" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This is the owner&#x27;s comment that followed (in which he didn&#x27;t even comment on what I said about the unnecessarily abusive language in several earlier comments):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Warm welcome by Henry Fischer" src="/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-admin-01-006e7ea2d59a0258e921458fd075fd01.png" width="752" height="566" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>His vision (also from the About page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We envision a world where technology works for us, not against us—and we want to prove to people they can make a real impact for themselves and others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x27;s very funny because I just recalled that, <em>after</em> the abuse that followed my comment on xx Network applications as possible alternatives to Wickr, I spent three hours creating (in the appropriate section) a post with xx Network resources, and answering questions from members who were interested in it. Making an impact, contributing, discussing with other knowledge-thirsty individuals, helping your fellow men better themselves - that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about, right?</p>
<p>And where&#x27;s that topic?</p>
<p>Oh, it&#x27;s nowhere!</p>
<p>They simply deleted my account, responses from the Wickr thread and all the content I&#x27;d created (even from the other generic topic), so it&#x27;s all gone now. They also wiped my xx Network topic from archive.org. &quot;We care a lot!&quot;</p>
<p>Since only the quoted parts of my messages survive and they deleted all my responses while leaving their own comments and attacks online, I think it&#x27;s perfectly appropriate to post about my Techlore experience here where they can&#x27;t censor and delete me.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="techlore-discussion-forum-tip">Techlore discussion forum tip<a href="#techlore-discussion-forum-tip" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Techlore discussion forum tip" title="Direct link to Techlore discussion forum tip">​</a></h4>
<p>Only ever make positive comments about Signal and don&#x27;t double-down on them if you want to last.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s my &quot;lesson learned&quot; from the short and miserable experience I had on that site.</p>
<p>I just checked on archive.org and found that penguin_terminal echoed my thoughts in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231205214557/https://discuss.techlore.tech/t/signal-usernames-are-finally-coming/6069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> comment made in 2023:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="penguin_terminal on Singal metadata" src="/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-by-penguin_terminal-05236500f3107cbb24544dd2e56c9c67.png" width="742" height="296" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t think of this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your ISP reports you to the authorizes when logs show you accessing servers used by Signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once your friendly government offices gets the &quot;date&quot; from Signal, they can ask the local telco or ISP for the hour, time and millisecond. Not that Signal already doesn&#x27;t give that, but getting it locally is easier and they can get your phone number or fixed line subscription details in the same go. Nice!</p>
<p>Like me, he got &quot;corrected&quot; another Signal fan, Tech-Tropper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely theoretical and wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh? Why? Here&#x27;s why Session sucks (according to Tech-Tropper):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, Session does not have PERFECT SECRECY. Just take your recovery code and login in with another device. You will see the messages sent in the last week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s simple - they &quot;just take your recovery code&quot;. Scientists estimate that 94% of Session users have their recovery code on a yellow Post-it note on the side of their refrigerator.</p>
<p>One last thing about that Wickr thread and techlore.tech I want to say is about that &quot;not touching this with a 50ft pole&quot; by the site owner. Does this make any sense to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy kept using Signal without PQ encryption (simply because Signal <strong>did not have any</strong>) for years. He presumably still uses it, despite Signal having his phone number, responds to warrants, while both Signal and AWS have access to his metadata</li>
<li>But xx Messenger is a disaster because SIDH was found to be vulnerable. Never mind that there&#x27;s no evidence that the app was exploited or even exploitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with people on that site and I won&#x27;t speculate about it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just happy that they deleted my account before I wasted too much time there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-chain-scam-signal-phone-numbers-good">xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good<a href="#xx-chain-scam-signal-phone-numbers-good" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good" title="Direct link to xx chain scam, Signal phone numbers good">​</a></h2>
<p>I want to elaborate on that scam accusation and the parallels with Signal, as I said I&#x27;d do at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>On Techlore forums they justify Signal&#x27;s &quot;need&quot; for phone numbers as the only way to prevent spam.</p>
<p>Ugh, okay, but that&#x27;s a &quot;in order to save the village, we had to destroy it&quot; kind of measure for a <em>privacy</em>-related application!</p>
<p>xx Network is still <a href="/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important">completely free and will introduce API limiting only for power users and only when postage becomes available</a>, you don&#x27;t need a phone number <em>and</em> you can use a network-native, decentralized identity. This has worked this way since 2022. Phoenixx also implements ENS-related identity (ENS).</p>
<p>xx Network is open to spam, that&#x27;s true. If it was spammed, postage would probably be implemented sooner. But if you don&#x27;t know a person&#x27;s xx Network identity (which you can&#x27;t unless they give it to you), there&#x27;s no way to spam them in the first place so spam is still not a problem.</p>
<p>If you now consider just the privacy aspect here: which of these is a bigger honeypot and potential (privacy) scam here?</p>
<p>One app has your phone number and some metadata.</p>
<p>The other doesn&#x27;t know anything about you, its gateways are decentralized in dozens of jurisdictions, there&#x27;s nowhere to &quot;register&quot; your data and there&#x27;s no plan for the average user to ever needing to pay anything.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think either of the platforms is a &quot;scam&quot;, but it&#x27;s easy to see which one is designed for privacy and why having a coin users don&#x27;t ever have to buy beats collecting phone numbers.</p>
<p>One of them is a major honeypot, that&#x27;s for sure.</p>

<p>This is a very simple test or &quot;proof of concept&quot;, if you will, for the inclusion of xx Network chat in Web applications.</p>
<p>To minimize the amount of work required, I used <code>iframe</code>s:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top frame shows a Web-based ImpressJS presentation</li>
<li>The bottom frame shows xx Network Haven (formerly Speakeasy) app - event organizer is showing his view of a channel while using the community instance at <a href="https://haven.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://haven.xx.network</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations-04cc190386b0a31034351ab708d55e42.png" width="1050" height="535" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>The chat participants don&#x27;t login to Haven in this Web browser.</p>
<p>The bottom frame only shows chat from event participants, but both the top and bottom frame are just for viewing of organizer&#x27;s content.</p>
<p>Any chat comment would be entered by each chat participant in their own xx Haven session (maybe another browser altogether).</p>
<p>Can guests comment and how?</p>
<p>The event organizer <em>may</em> share the invitation link and password in order to allow participants to comment from own Haven instance (accessed in the participant&#x27;s browser), but that is optional.</p>
<p>We have several possible scenarios. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the event owner can chat (answer voice questions, share links...)</li>
<li>Event owner and event guests (panelists, for example) chat, while guests can only view their comments in that <code>iframe</code> above</li>
<li>If event guests are provided with the channel invite, they can login to xx Haven (own or public instance) and chat (ask questions, comment, etc.) as well</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-works-and-what-doesnt">What works and what doesn&#x27;t<a href="#what-works-and-what-doesnt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What works and what doesn&#x27;t" title="Direct link to What works and what doesn&#x27;t">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a very basic, no-code PoC, so it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s not usable in this form.</p>
<p>Production-worthy setup would require some customization of at least xx Haven CSS, if not the application itself.</p>
<p>But even so, we can appreciate and highlight some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>No email or other identity needs to be shared with the organizer, but panelists or viewers <em>may</em> choose to identify themselves by providing a signed proof of external identity</li>
<li>Guests/panelists and possibly viewers receive the link - maybe it&#x27;s shared in the presentation, maybe in another xx Haven channel - but links are not personalized and we can&#x27;t know who is the author of each comment</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events open to public comments may be abused by spammers. Although individual accounts can be blocked by channel admin, automated spam attacks would be laborious to deal with so fully open events may be hard to manage</li>
<li>Layout: obviously the xx Haven frame doesn&#x27;t use space economically. We&#x27;d have to create an instance that only exposes the chat itself, and possibly put that &quot;chat box&quot; in a narrow, vertical frame to the right</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Network currently retains messages for three weeks which may be both good and bad depending on use case.</p>

<p>It may be tricky to login to xx Haven here, but it&#x27;s easy to figure out once you realize you can scroll both left-right and up-down within the bottom frame.</p>

<p>While this &quot;integration&quot; isn&#x27;t even an integration - it&#x27;s just two <code>iframe</code>s - I think it does show the opportunity for using xx Network for events in which the identity of each chat participant can remain hidden and any comments cannot be linked to them even by the event organizer.</p>
<p>This runs contrary to the approach taken by most marketing-focused events - in the sense that participants&#x27; privacy <em>decreases</em> engagement and tracking - but for events where privacy of the commenter is important, there&#x27;s no way to link a participant&#x27;s IP address with comments.</p>
<p>A participant&#x27;s IP address could be hidden by accessing the Web event address over Tor, but comments may be entered directly in participant&#x27;s own instance of xx Haven which can even be running locally (e.g. in container).</p>
<p>Furthermore, xx Haven provides unique, reusable identities (bossCompartmentalisedDisownment in the first screenshot), so each network identity can be reused without disclosing the participant&#x27;s IP address and/or true identity. This may be useful in situations where a participant wishes to be recognized - for example, a designated identity may be reused across events to provide support or engage in 1-on-1 chat with participants for follow up.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_i4In padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/xx-network">xx network</a></li><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/apps">apps</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_RyL6"><a href="/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not">SecureDrop keeps themselves busy reinventing the wheel</a></h2><div class="container_d2a9 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-05-08T00:00:00.000Z">May 8, 2024</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_tJ1H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/armchairancap.png" alt="ArmchairAncap"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ArmchairAncap</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1589835968911413249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&#x27;ve said it already</a> so I&#x27;ll just rephrase: it takes three PhDs to use SecureDrop - one admin, one journalist and one user.</p>
<p>But you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know, so instead of fixing the complicated mess that (current) SecureDrop is - which could be done by including <strong>any</strong> viable open source decentralized messenger into their packaged solution - they&#x27;re coming up with <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new protocol</a> of their own. Of course.</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is implemented here is a small-scale, self-contained, anonymous message box, where anonymous parties (sources) can contact and receive replies from trusted parties (journalists).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where&#x27;s the server?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server: For this project, a server might be a physical dedicated server housed in a trusted location, a physical server in an untrusted location, or a virtual server in a trusted or untrusted context. Besides the initial setup, all the connections to the server have to happen though the Tor Hidden Service Protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fine, I&#x27;ll just set up my own Hidden Service.</p>
<p>But, does Source need a PhD?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Source(s): No on-device persistence shall be required for a source to interact with the system; they should be able to conduct all communications using only a single, theoretically-memorizable passphrase. The source uses Tor Browser to preserve their anonymity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just using Tor Browser properly is very hard. Haven users don&#x27;t need to use Tor, but they may if they wish. Because with Haven, Tor is optional so it&#x27;s much harder to use Tor incorrectly if either party does choose to use it for secure direct messaging.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d even say that modern messaging apps like xx Network&#x27;s Haven almost <em>cannot</em> be used incorrectly. Choose a strong password and don&#x27;t have a spyware infested browser or OS. That&#x27;s basically it.</p>
<p>But this is SecureDrop, so here we go again... Start by subscribing to Udemy&#x27;s &quot;Python from Zero to Hero&quot;...</p>

<p>In this approach Source shares files over a Tor Hidden Service and informs a Journalist to download the file.</p>
<p>This doesn&#x27;t require <em>any</em> development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journalist publishes their Haven nick (e.g. MrTriggerHappyJourno)</li>
<li>Source runs owns <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haven container</a> or accesses other party&#x27;s (e.g. public) Haven instance to create their own identity (DrDeepThroat)</li>
<li>Source initiates chat with Journalist using Haven by contacting them directly and inviting them to personal chat channel with DrDeepThroat and MrTriggerHappyJourno as the only participants</li>
<li>If the Source decides to share their files, they start Onion container with Hidden (Web) Service and share the link to the Journalist in Haven private chat</li>
</ul>
<p>I provide a walk-through and sample configuration files below.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="push-method">Push method<a href="#push-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push method" title="Direct link to Push method">​</a></h3>
<p>This approach follows SecureDrop&#x27;s approach where the &quot;file upload&quot; site is operated by Journalist. That seems like a very risky idea to me - Sources would better off uploading files to one of decentralized S3 services - but that&#x27;s how SecureDrop does it.</p>
<p>In this approach they would still use a decentralized secure messenger (Haven from xx Network or some other) and the same Web server app Secure Drop already has.</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s easier to use Haven and Pull method than SecureDrop (Push method) and I&#x27;ll show you why.</p>
<p>With Docker installed, the Source downloads this repository from Tor Browser or over SOCKS5 proxy (using git cli) and starts all the services they&#x27;ll need.</p>

<p>Haven is now running on localhost (temporary VM) and Caddy provides HTTPS proxy at <a href="https://localhost:443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://localhost:443</a> to Source. This takes care of secure messaging and metadata shredding.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, see <a href="/docs/haven-user-guide/get-started">this guide</a> or fire up your own instance.</p>

<p>This list below shows all services in this Docker Compose.</p>
<p>The configuration files can be in line with best practices and thereby require <strong>zero configuration</strong> by either Source (they use Haven and Web server) or Journalist (they use own instance of Haven).</p>
<ul>
<li>Caddy - HTTPS proxy for Haven</li>
<li>NGINX - Web server that runs my Tor Hidden (Web) Service</li>
<li>Haven - local (personal) instance of Haven (to create Haven identity and chat with Journalist)</li>

<p>The <code>hostname</code> file is in the <code>tor-service</code> directory (relative to repo clone location: <code>./xx-haven-container/tor/tor-service/</code>).</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all it takes to visit the service on Tor - use Tor Browser to access that link.</p>
<p>But, what is our NGINX service sharing/serving?</p>

<p>Actually, <code>index.html</code> isn&#x27;t even necessary - it&#x27;s there to make this demo simpler - by being able to view index.html which links to file.txt.</p>
<p>In any case, our Source shares 6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion with his Journalist and that&#x27;s it.</p>

<p>After the Journalist confirms they got the file in Haven chat channel, the Source uses CTRL+C to stop Docker service and removes everything (the entire ./xx-haven-container/ directory or - even better - the entire temporary VM if they had one).</p>

<p>With Tor identity removed, next time the Sources wishes to use the same stack they have a new Onion address while Haven identity could be restored if they backed it up (by exporting it from Haven Web UI to JSON file) and stored in a secure location.</p>
<p>Back to those file names: our Source could share a direct link to the file (6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion/file.txt) and file.txt could be encrypted if you wanted the extra security - the Source may share that password with the Journalist in their private Haven chat channel.</p>
<p>The password could be shared with the Journalist in Haven, but if the file is randomly named there&#x27;s no risk of anyone guessing this file name on a Hidden Service address with directory listing disabled (it is disabled by default on NGINX).</p>
<p>To take that approach, remove index.html and move the content file to a random name:</p>

<p>All that&#x27;s necessary here is to put your content in ./tor-docs/. There&#x27;s no configuration of any kind. For &quot;production&quot; purposes a project could further improve configuration files included, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>caddy_config/ - auto-configured</li>
<li>caddy_data/ - auto-configured</li>
<li>Caddyfile - 3-line template file for reverse proxy on <code>localhost</code>, preconfigured</li>
<li>docker-compose.yml - Docker Compose file, preconfigured</li>
<li>tor-config/ - Tor Hidden Service configuration file (for NGINX), preconfigured</li>
<li>tor-docs/  - file(s) shared over Hidden Service (file.txt, etc.)</li>
<li>tor-service/ - Tor Hidden Service identity file (hostname, pub/priv key) - auto-generated if missing</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t &quot;more secure&quot; than their latest PoC, but is it worse?</p>

<p>SecureDrop wants to reinvent their own wheel despite the fact that there are several good decentralized, secure messengers.</p>
<p>Normally, secure drops start with secure messaging and they&#x27;d be better off if they simply picked one of existing options.</p>
<p>Once that&#x27;s taken care of, file upload/download is no longer difficult when done on Onion network.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say these are &quot;solved problems&quot;, but the point here isn&#x27;t that xx Network&#x27;s Haven &quot;solved&quot; the problem of secure messaging (maybe it did, maybe it didn&#x27;t - <a href="https://xx.network/whitepapers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see for yourself</a>). It is that SecureDrop very likely can&#x27;t solve it <em>better</em> than other decentralized messengers.</p>
<p>They ought to stop dreaming about their own &quot;protocol&quot; and do what they&#x27;re supposed to do which is making it easy to share files in private.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_i4In padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/xx-network">xx network</a></li><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/tor">tor</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_RyL6"><a href="/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view">First they came for CEXes, then for DEXes</a></h2><div class="container_d2a9 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-04-11T00:00:00.000Z">April 11, 2024</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_tJ1H"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/armchairancap.png" alt="ArmchairAncap"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/armchairancap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ArmchairAncap</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><ul>

<p>Let&#x27;s soak in the wisdom of X for a minute.</p>
<p>(Presumed) teenage shitcoiner 1 on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one that uses Uniswap cares about the SEC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SEC doesn&#x27;t care that no one who uses Uniswap doesn&#x27;t care about the SEC.</p>
<p>All they need to do is to persuade Mr. Adams and fellow developers to pick another hobby (after they beat them in a Biden kangaroo court).</p>
<p>(Presumed) teenage shitcoiner 2 on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Dexes like uniswap, SEC can bring down the domain but easily anyone can setup a Dex exchange like Uniswap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like anyone can setup and run a coin mixer - they can&#x27;t, not for long anyway.</p>
<p>These SEC activities aren&#x27;t unexpected.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/06/shapeshift-settles-sec-charges-it-sold-crypto-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">happened before</a> to ShapeShift which - curiously enough (see the link) - just settled with the SEC some five weeks ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The federal regulator instituted a cease-and-desist against ShapeShift, which dissolved its U.S. crypto exchange in 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very encouraging (for the SEC) - it took years, but now it&#x27;s done!</p>
<p>One down, few more to go! Centralized or decentralized doesn&#x27;t matter - as long as there&#x27;s a person that can be sued, they&#x27;re good to go after them. (In the case of the US government they don&#x27;t even care if you&#x27;re a US citizen or resident.)</p>
<p>Maybe some used to think - apparently, some on X still do to this day - that one can just ignore the delistings of their coins from CEX or the draconian anti-privacy and anti-liberty laws taking effect in EU and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not possible as long as we have these quasi-capitalist and socialist governments unite in their fascist and globalist mission to eliminate freedom.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine what comes next - it&#x27;s not unlike what I said in the post <a href="/blog/2024/03/23/eu-legislation-untenable-for-privacy-coin-users">EU puts EU-based privacy coin users in untenable position</a>. In fact, it&#x27;s the same thing, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s how I see this will play out for DEXes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prominent US-based DEX developers, non-profits, community members, server operators are silenced</li>
<li>Many users drop off as well</li>
<li>The same thing happens worldwide</li>
<li>&quot;Anonymous&quot; (in their opinion) community members continue development and operations (decentralized Git, hidden services on Tor, etc.), but volumes are small and liquidity sucks</li>
<li>Because anonymity and reputation don&#x27;t mix well, scams increase (malicious commits, for example), fundraising becomes hard, and their user base a tiny fraction of what it used to be</li>
</ul>
<p>Decentralized Exchanges won&#x27;t disappear, but they&#x27;re in for a very difficult period.</p>
<p>Another possibility - not immediate, but 3-5 years from now - is that the West sets up some version of the commie firewall that detects and blocks IP addresses of known DEX nodes. I <em>know</em> that&#x27;s very difficult to do well, but so is today&#x27;s blocking of general Internet in certain hellholes around world which does work very well. All it takes is a bit of disruption and a globally disruptive legal action which all major governments and globalist organizations seem to be eager to team up on.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="impact-on-cryptocurrencies">Impact on cryptocurrencies<a href="#impact-on-cryptocurrencies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact on cryptocurrencies" title="Direct link to Impact on cryptocurrencies">​</a></h2>
<p>It&#x27;s easy to think this could mainly impact &quot;illegal&quot; (privacy) coins. That was my first thought, at least.</p>
<p>But that is not the case. It will impact <em>all DEX users</em>, <em>all DEX exchanges</em> and therefore <em>all coins</em>.</p>
<p>In the case of major crypto-currencies, any coin that other coins are denominated in - primarily stablecoins, but also BTC, ETH and others.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe - in I&#x27;m right - privacy coins could regain some of the lost popularity among the leftover DeFi hardliners, but if you lose 90% of users and gain 20%, that&#x27;s still not a great result and you&#x27;re not growing or &quot;changing the world&quot; (sorry, that&#x27;s as naive as I am willing to go - I won&#x27;t say &quot;democratizing finance&quot;).</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve just looked at the past 12 months of Ethereum vs. Monero on Google Trends. I assume the Google globalists aren&#x27;t feeding us fake trends, although we can&#x27;t exclude that possibility.</p>
<p>If you remove Ethereum from the chart and look at Monero alone, you&#x27;ll see it went up a lot in late 2023 and then dropped off. I think it will drop even further (see that post on EU above).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Google Trends - Ethereum vs Monero" src="/assets/images/2024-04-11-interest-over-time-ethereum-vs-monero-1y-1eb23d4963088df6f110527fc3cabfca.png" width="1138" height="357" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>But when Ethereum is added to the chart, Monero looks flat and barely registers.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not an apples-to-apples comparison, I know, but it shows two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average user cares about flipping coins, not about privacy (not something I like to see, but let&#x27;s admit it)</li>
<li>Despite the ongoing attack on privacy (and other) crypto-currencies in the EU, Monero is attracting just a small fraction of crypto-currency users, which I think confirms my expectation that most crypto-exchange users will give up or trade &quot;legal and regulated coins&quot; (completely useless circle-jerk as far as I&#x27;m concerned - it&#x27;s no different from flipping FANGs all day long)</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe some &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; like that Bukele guy (not benevolent in my opinion, but I&#x27;m trying to think like the average teenage Bitcoin fan on X) permits DEX in their country and some prominent developers give up citizenship and relocate there, but this can&#x27;t do anything for the users in countries where the use of decentralized exchanges is illegal.</p>
<p>Would economic and political gains from such policies be net-positive? Probably not. Maybe that&#x27;d earn sanctions, cut them off from the IMF/WB, etc. I&#x27;m not suggesting utilitarianism, but merely the fact that politicians have to consider it as there would be a price to pay.</p>
<p>Assuming some jurisdictions decide to harbor such activities, the next problem to consider is DEX users&#x27; privacy.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt to suggest xx Network mixnet (cMixx) could be used to circumvent the problem. This solution already exists and works (see <a href="https://github.com/xx-labs/proxxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxxy</a>) and we&#x27;ll probably see it as an extension or &quot;Web 3 app&quot; in browsers like <a href="https://carbon.website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon</a> one day.</p>
<p>How many users will dare to violate laws this way? I&#x27;d say a small minority - primarily those from countries with governments &quot;who haven&#x27;t gotten their shit together&quot; (yet).</p>
<p>Tor Browser may be another option, although it&#x27;s not as good a solution as cMixx. It&#x27;s harder to use correctly, and setting up malicious Tor nodes costs next to nothing. In fact it does cost nothing if you&#x27;re a government and fund that activity with freshly printed money or new public debt.</p>

<p>xx Network&#x27;s Proxxy approach acts as a mixing proxy gateway between your client (for example, Carbon browser) and the server (for example, DEX server nodes). This is useful because it breaks the link between DEX activity (observable by all) and user&#x27;s IP and location.</p>
<p>It also hides the connection between a wallet (addresses) and the owner. For non-private coins, a DEX observer would see there&#x27;s a wallet with 123 XYZ coins, and monitor ins and outs, but they couldn&#x27;t see who owns it. If one were to trade on a DEX via Proxxy, they could do that in privacy and exit to a privacy coin (so that the last leg is also anonymized on-chain).</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s not forget that a DEX could route all its messages over xx Network&#x27;s cMix protocol. <a href="https://dashboard.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network dashboard</a> currently shows 3000 messages per second. That could be enough for a DEX that doesn&#x27;t attempt to provide near real-time settlement.</p>

<p>3000 messages per second is plenty, and can scale as soon as more nodes are added to the network (which is a function of network economics, but ultimately driven by demand which is currently a community decision and later may become a function of postage fees - more users, more nodes chasing their share of xx Network cMixx postage).</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not optimistic about this development now and the prospects for crypto-currencies in coming years.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is already a joke (see the recent news on how almost 50% of mined coins are routed to a single address - presumably almost 50% of &quot;virgin coins&quot; are bought by Wall Street custodians) and Ethereum isn&#x27;t far behind (just wait until the first ETFs appear - it&#x27;s going to be worse, because of staking which lets Wall Street farm virgin coins directly).</p>
<p>Crypto-enthusiasts think they (or &quot;someone&quot;) can ignore what governments do &quot;because decentralized&quot;. That works only until they knock on your door.</p>
<p>xx Network (Proxxy, etc.) can help and will help to some extent, but in a NWO environment it still can be stopped.</p>
<p>The only way this can be solved in the long term is by fighting centralization and that means civic engagement against globalists, dictators and autocrats - from the UN over governments of large political unions down to small countries.</p>
<p>Code is law, but not the law.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_i4In padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/xx-network">xx network</a></li><li class="tag_pKY9"><a class="tag_npp9 tagRegular_LeBw" href="/blog/tags/defi">defi</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Local resources</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Tutorials and guides</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/xx-directory">xx Network directory</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Encrypted messenger comparison</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">External resources</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://forum.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">xx Network Community Forum<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_J_Gs"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://learn.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">xx Network Learning Center</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://haven.xx.network/join?0Name=xxGeneralChat&amp;1Description=Talking+about+the+xx+network&amp;2Level=Public&amp;3Created=1674152234202224215&amp;e=%2FqE8BEgQQkXC6n0yxeXGQjvyklaRH6Z%2BWu8qvbFxiuw%3D&amp;k=RMfN%2B9pD%2FJCzPTIzPk%2Bpf0ThKPvI425hye4JqUxi3iA%3D&amp;l=368&amp;m=0&amp;p=1&amp;s=rb%2BrK0HsOYcPpTF6KkpuDWxh7scZbj74kVMHuwhgUR0%3D&amp;v=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">xx Network Haven (xxGeneralChat)<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_J_Gs"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Twitter</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/xx_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">xx Network on Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_J_Gs"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/mises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Mises Institute<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_J_Gs"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/ArmchairAncap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">ArmchairAncap<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_J_Gs"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 (CC-BY) by ArmchairAncap.
