<p>The idea is to crowdsource funds for a CrowdSwap liquidity pool for WXX (BRC20), which is a wrapped WXX (ERC20), which itself is wrapped XX on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Since BNB and Ethereum are similar, re-wrapping <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/ethereum/0x171120219d3223e008558654ec3254a0f206edb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WXX (ERC20)</a> - issued by the xx Foundation - is secure and easy.</p>
<p>Now some of the WXX (ERC20) that's available on Uniswap will be re-wrapped as WXX (BRC20), as I understand it, making it easy to move liquidity between DEXes. Pancake swap will be added later.</p>
<p>Read about it <a href="https://xx.network/blog/crowdswap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>My interest here is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a believer in DEX</li>
<li>xx token hasn't been able to get listed at large centralized exchanges because its privacy options make it look fishy (as if it's a privacy coin, which it is not)</li>
<li>Historically DEXes have had a problem with liquidity. Newest one don't, but these still do, so they need help</li>
<li>There are rewards (funded by xx Foundation), so it's not just free donation of liquidity - there are benefits for those who participate to help with liquidity of decentralized XX markets</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="buying-process">Buying process<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/17/buying-wxx-bep20-wrapped-xx-coin#buying-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Buying process" title="Direct link to Buying process">​</a></h2>
<p>Read the link above for the details, but ignoring the conditions (very important, so you need to read the link), the "doing" part goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need at least the equivalent of $105 or so in crypto, as the minimum purchase is $100 and there are other fees involved</li>
<li>Pick a wallet which can work with <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.crowdswap.org</a> and connect it</li>
<li>In user profile, fill in a name, email, and pick username for Crowdswap (I think that's mostly for referrals, there's no login or password)</li>
<li>Find the xx private sale for WXX on <strong>Opportunity</strong> page</li>
<li>You need to agree and "sign" an agreement to be able to actually perform a transaction</li>
<li>If you're not in one of trouble countries, a simple KYC may be necessary (for me it was very a painless process, but it may depend on your IP or who knows what)</li>
</ul>

<p>Metamask was a frustrating experience for UDST (I could have used Ethereum, but I didn't want to pay their gas fees), so I gave up and used BNB chain in another wallet.</p>

<p>I screwed up at first - I sent USDT to a BNB wallet, but didn't have any native coins to do anything that, so I also had to send some dust for the gas. Stupid...</p>
<p>Once that was solved, and all the steps from the list above done, I was able to pay:</p>

<p>That was close to 2000 WXX(BRC20), about the same price that one can get on MEXC (more on that later).</p>

<p>The wallet asked for a confirmation:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="WXX purchase completed" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-12-17-buying-wxx-bep20-wrapped-wxx-dex-crowdswap-coin-02-aa1c0ac16ff71c9a612b4ea5fa317678.png" width="1024" height="814" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>With that I successfully completed the first "test" transaction in this private sale!</p>
<p>I paid the following transaction fees from the wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.0000x BNB to sign the purchase agreement ("empty" transaction)</li>
<li>0.000x BNB purchase coins (USDT on BNB transferred to the seller)</li>
</ul>
<p>One BNB is around $370 so it was very cheap. I don't know how much it'd cost on Ethereum, but probably more.</p>
<p>The fee I paid to send USDT(BNB) and BNB tokens from a CEX to the wallet isn't shown, as it's collected at the source.</p>
<p>Currently XX/USDT at MEXC is the same as this, so there's no immediate financial benefit to buying, but I plan to buy more because I want to provide liquidity for the XX pairs on decentralized exchanges.</p>

<p>To fund my purchases of WXX(BRC20) I may sell some of my "non-wrapped" XX coins.</p>
<p>As others will likely do the same, it's is expected that the price of XX/USDT on MEXC (the biggest XX CEX market) will remain the same as the crowdsale price.</p>
<p>So... Do not buy WXX (or XX) thinking it's some crazy pump &amp; dump scheme. It's not.</p>

<ul>
<li>Liquidity for decentralized XX token markets</li>
<li>Users new to xx Network will become familiar with DEX <em>and</em> cMixx (very important, as opposed to airdrops)</li>
<li>Affordable campaign to reach out to new users</li>
<li>Technical simplicity (uses existing XX-to-WXX contract on Ethereum)</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as the sale lasts, it puts a ceiling on the price of xx token, because the sale is based on the fixed priced of xx token (I guess it had to be done that way), so MEXC and other markets will be "stuck" in a narrow range and miss the ongoing bubble. I don't care, but some folks do.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think overall it's a very positive development for xx token.</p>

<p>These DEXes (Uniswap, Crowdswap, and in the future Pacakeswap) lessen the need for T1/T2 CEX.</p>

<p>As incentives and rewards are available and I'm not looking to sell or exit XX, buying some WXX (BRC20) wasn't a difficult decision to make.</p>
<p>I also used this opportunity as an excuse to learn about the process of buying using the minimum (US$100-ish) amount. I'll repeat this multiple times with larger amounts before the sale ends.</p>
<p>The price of XX (and WXX) will remain "stuck" for 2 months, but benefits are going to be higher than this small inconvenience.</p>
<p>I hope in 2025 XX also makes it to a next-generation DEX (one of those that will appear on Supra, for example). Spreads will become so narrow and liquidity "unlimited"! At that big CEX listings will become uninteresting. But until then and even after then, we need choices and competition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'll make this one short because there aren't many such opinions.</p>
<p>Polkadot is a DAO, and has governance built-in.</p>
<p>It is actually very well done and saves a lot of time to anyone building a blockchain-based DAO - xx Network uses it as well.</p>
<p>What, then, is the problem?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="symptoms">Symptoms<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks#symptoms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Symptoms" title="Direct link to Symptoms">​</a></h2>
<p>My knowledge of Polkadot is somewhat limited - I haven't participated and used it for years.</p>
<p>But I've followed it closely this year and I've used Kusama, for example.</p>
<p>xx Network is also a DAO and uses essentially the same stack, so there isn't much an xx Network user needs to learn infrastructure-wise. What is needed to understand is observation - seeing how it's used, what users think about it, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on those observations, I've noticed several symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims that "whale" projects are milking the system by (easily) getting (undeserved) funding</li>
<li>Opinions that many DAO-funded projects suck</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction with how the DAO "democracy" works in practice</li>
<li>Observations on disengaged participation (example: people nominate, but don't vote on anything even as they login to wallet to collect rewards or transfer funds)</li>
<li>All sorts of stupid ideas are getting traction (and possibly DAO-approved funding - this I estimate based on seeing how much traction uterrly senseless ideas get in the Polkadot community)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, these are the same weaknesses that we can observe in Western democracies.</p>
<p>Shockingly, or perhaps not at all, some still claim the DAO is functioning "exceptionally well". I guess I'd claim that as well if I was milking the system to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>The obvious truth is governance is not functioning well at all.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="why-polkadot-governance-sucks">Why Polkadot governance sucks?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks#why-polkadot-governance-sucks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Polkadot governance sucks?" title="Direct link to Why Polkadot governance sucks?">​</a></h2>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>the DAO destroys, rather than creates, competition [1]</li>
<li>the DAO picks winners</li>
<li>the DAO thereby creates losers (once a winner for is picked, all others are fxxed because unless they're vastly superior they stand no chance of charging for their service and their funding dries up)</li>
<li>the DAO causes inflation with such unnecessary and excessive spending</li>
<li>the DAO hurts the ecosystem because it retards free markets that let users vote with their (subscription) tokens. Services that would normally compete and pass their costs (plus some extra value) to users siply don't appear because of this more-or-less "winner takes all" system created by the DAO</li>
<li>Everyone gets to vote, and that includes self-serving cronies, ignoramuses and people who have no idea about anything (many may be underage, although their stakes are usually (and thanfully) too low to matter)</li>
</ul>
<p>[1] There's competition in the Art of Proposals and vote marshaling, all right, just not in projects and services</p>
<p>My forked (upstream was funded by the DAO, I suppose?) project for <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access">token-gated</a> access to Web3 apps is a good example. I think the idea is great and use cases many (as I explain in that blog post). If you look around, you'll see there have been many asks for this functionality. For example, Discord channels could be gated the same way based on one's holdings of tokens, assets or NFTs. Even Web2 forums could use it.</p>
<p>Yet, no one maintains such an app for Polkadot, and "small" Web3 sites don't even exist. It's a simple app and people funded by the DAO like to apply for $500 grants rather than smaller projects that general users could use to create a "no-code" Web3 experience or bridge Web2 apps to Web3.</p>
<p>Another example is various "major" Web sites in the Polkadot ecosystem. They're barely useful and often bloated (more "features" means more funds).</p>
<p>Anyway, how to fix it? The same way it's done in Western democracies: by educating the voter, which is a centuries-long process and not something that will happen in our lifetime.</p>
<p>For a comparison, I think xx Network works better. It's not good enough, but it's not a disaster either.</p>
<p>Why is that? I think it's because it has better people, which is how it was bootstrapped. This isn't to say Polkadot has bad people, but it's been a while and they don't seem as engaged in the DAO as the original xx Network team.</p>
<p>xx Network is more of a constitutional republic, while Polkadot is a democracy. Even though both use the same code, the latter is already corrupt beyond repair. The USA vs. the European Union.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't know how they can get enough votes to do anything but keep destroying what the founder(s) and early volunteers built.</p>

Most had interest in making <code>DOT</code> and <code>KSM</code> appreciate in value. Today's DAO leeches are nothing like the early volunteers.</p><p>If you're contributing only as long as they pay you, you're more akin to a bureaucrat or public sector worker. Not everyone is, but most are.</p></div></div>
<p>Some minor improvements can be made - for example they recently modified inflation rate, which is now less stupid. But I don't think majority of voters would support any proposal that significantly impacts their disproportional or undeserved benefits. It's like expecting public sector unions to support budget cuts.</p>
<p>Usually a short-term solution - or interim solution - is to have a benevolent populist dictator. Someone like Linus Torvalds, who is liked enough to be given extra power. That's great as long as the person is around, and goes south quickly as soon as he gets replaced by a lesser person.</p>
<p>In addition to that being a short-term solution, at this point it the DAO can't even do that because there's no mechanism for this to happen. It's wrongly bootstrapped/wired.</p>
<p>Whether it's done by a dictator or a powerful group, here's what I think would fix a lot of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burn all excess treasury funds not required for basic expenses plus some emergency reserve</li>
<li>Eliminate funding of most projects excluding essential infrastructure (such as a bare bones blockchain explorer) and let them compete for paying customers on their own</li>
<li>Reorganize funding so that it's split by categories and done only over very short term (3 to 6 months - just enough to let them do a PoC and be able to seek funding). Then modify voting so that those who support funding be mildly on the hook (use long-term conviction proportional to cost of spending they choose to support)</li>
<li>Strengthen the role of on-chain identity to bring more transparency to decision-making and spending</li>
<li>Extend unstaking period to months and years, so that it becomes lucrative to vote with higher conviction and divest slower</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these items is impossible to happen, but even if it did, it wouldn't last long: cronies and ingnoramuses would start taking over again, possibly starting at the top (with someone who'd undo everything even faster).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="take-away">Take-away<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/15/why-polkadot-governance-sucks#take-away" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Take-away" title="Direct link to Take-away">​</a></h2>
<p>The same tool used by different people can lead to a very different result.</p>
<p>The Polkadot DAO is failing, but that doesn't mean it's worse than other crypto projects. Most other projects are much worse, which is why I'm happy to be part of the greater Polkadot ecosystem and xx Network in particular.</p>
<p>Real and sustainable change requires education, which takes decades and maybe even centuries. We won't live long enough to see it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those of us who care have to do what we can to slow that decline and make our projects stay around long enough until most "DAOists" learn to act in common interest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Altcoin Daily <a href="https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1867719193577324947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a pumping "suggestion" about the top quantum-computing resistant coins for 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>CELL</li>
<li>OZO</li>
<li>QRL</li>
</ul>
<p>What does that even mean? Nothing, really.</p>
<p>It's a low-effort post (maybe even an AI-generated shitpost) meant to gain followers and have the shills post their nonsense comments.</p>
<p>They post a the top three symbols from CMC's list of PQ coins with highest market capitalization, and then those who are involved in PQ-related projects need to explain to "investors" which of them is "the best" and why:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Top CoinMarketCap PQ coins in December 2024" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-04-14-cmc-top-pq-coins-58a4dcdb6fdc41a6b1d9824ab9a082d4.png" width="929" height="587" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>And in Altcoin Daily's post CELL is listed a the top - in alphabetical order - but QRL is listed before OZO, which may be due to OZO paying less or nothing for that post.</p>
<p>But still, what does this mean?</p>
<p>Every few days I hear some speculator asking how xx Network compares to this or that coin, why xx Network isn't "pumping", and such.</p>
<p>Everyone should read and answer for themselves, but I admin I haven't done it as well because I thought most of it is nonsense and a waste of time. Fundamentally, privacy means inconvenience and extra cost (in time or hardware or software), so privacy-focused solutions are not easy to sell.</p>
<p>But now this is a topic that we are expected to have an opinion about, so let's take a look at what these projects are, their claims, are and <em>whether</em> they should be compared with xx Network (and if so, how).</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="cellframe-cell">Cellframe (CELL)<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily#cellframe-cell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cellframe (CELL)" title="Direct link to Cellframe (CELL)">​</a></h2>
<p>From their <a href="https://cellframe.net/white-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By design, Cellframe’s architecture is a structure with a dual-layer sharding. The first layer (heterogeneous layer) can launch customizable subchains and tokens. On the second layer (homogeneous layer), subchains are organized in Cells. Due to interoperability features we plan to build an ecosystem of services where every app (or dapp) will have an opportunity to exchange information with another app in a p2p manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is nice, but as always, I don't like this rebuilding of the wheel.</p>
<p>Everyone has a dApp platform... Including xx Chain (and all Substrate-based chains). Even Polkadot - a top coin - doesn't have enough apps (and their ecosystem has <strong>hundreds</strong>), and can't sustain a stablecoin because there's not enough liquidity compared to "the top dogs". What are the chances these guys can make it?</p>
<p>Or take this example from the sme white paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main idea of Cellframe is multiple subchains, containing Plasma (any blockchain element) inside of syngeneic Cells (shards).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this sound like Polkadot's parachains (which xx Netowrk could adopt and use)? Does</p>
<p>And from the <a href="https://cellframe.net/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap page</a>, here's what is <em>yet to be done</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release of mechanism for stakers to delegate keys to validators using Cellframe Dashboard (xx Chain has Simple Staking, adopted from the Polkadot ecosytem)</li>
<li>EVM-compatible service (xx Chain could adopt it from Polkadot ecosystem)</li>
<li>They're developing own format of interchangeable tokens (besed on the numbers, such as CF-20, it's similar to Ethereum's)</li>
<li>Interoperability protocol, bridging with other blockchains (PolkadotSDK has several and more will be added faster than Cellframe can do it. xx Chain uses two token bridges (XRP and Ethereum))</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see the main <a href="https://cellframe.net/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> I have with Cellframe is they are reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Examples from two recent releases, 5.3-327 and 5.3-277:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue with serialization/deserialization of data in JSON-RPC</li>
<li>Fork auto-resolution mechanism</li>
<li>Functionality of the <code>tx_history-addr</code> command</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what happens when you decide to build the wheel from scratch. Ongoing and yet-to-be discovered security and other problems.</p>
<p>If you're META or Ethereum, maybe you can pull it off. If you're not, well...</p>
<p>Interestingly Cellframe runs a <a href="https://kelvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPN</a>, with the following pricing:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="CELL VPN - KELVPN" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-04-14-cell-vpn-pricing-7e3a19c035265925e2f632f6c4b37304.png" width="706" height="639" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork">Nym</a> and the risks I mentioned there (read it to get the idea, if you don't already have it)...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Cellframe and KelVPN are products from the same parent company, “Demlabs,” KelVPN is a separate project with a dedicated developer team. KelVPN is the first service built on Cellframe, which is a blockchain platform for different decentralized services. KelVPN is based on the Cellframe parachain and uses Cellframe SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a comparison, search this blog for "postage" or take a look at <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#introduction">this post</a>: xx Network is a DAO and plans to provide paid mixnet servics in what I think is a much better way (no "parent company" and associated risks, crypto-only payments with XX coin obtained from a DEX or CEX).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cellframe.net/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQs</a> gives the following examples of services that could run on Cellframe:</p>
<ul>
<li>decentralized VPNs and CDNs</li>
<li>messengers and social networks</li>
<li>voting</li>
</ul>
<p>Messaging has worked on xx Network for years and is the focus of the network. Voting has also undergone a lot of research (see <a href="https://votexx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Votexx</a>) and implemented for <a href="https://worldcoin.org/wave0-grant-recipients/votexx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldcoin</a>.</p>
<p>It appears some Cellframe services (or "ideas" of services) overlap with Nym's, others with other projects (e.g. StorJ for CNDs), and some with xx Network (except that xx Network has had them for a while and are xx Network's main focus).</p>
<p>PQ-wise, Cellframe uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon. I haven't looked into these yet.</p>

<p>It reminds me of Nym, but with some Ethereum features (basically nothing that one can't do on PolkadotSDK chains).</p>
<p>While some use cases seem similar to xx Network's, they don't really have those apps because they've been busy rebuilding the wheel.</p>

<p>QRL has been around for a long time (longer than xx Network, six years vs three for xx Network), and has a decent following.</p>
<p>QRL's mission is a PQ chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide enterprise grade security to the blockchain space with the future quantum threat in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what they have at CMC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is a 'fully quantum resistant blockchain network, using PQ-CRYPTO recommended/IETF standardized cryptography'. The QRL utilizes a hash-based eXtended Merkle Tree Signature Scheme (XMSS) instead of ECDSA, which is reportedly vulnerable to quantum attacks and found in many other blockchain projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's that about ECDSA? Well, <a href="https://fullcirclesecurity.org/2024/11/26/nist-announces-the-end-of-rsa-and-ecdsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST</a> announced its depreciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.. of RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA encryption algorithms by 2030, with a full disallowance by 2035.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OMG, we're screwed!!!</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current draft</a> of this deprecation plan says (as of 2024/12/14):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="ECDSA depreciation schedule - draft" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-04-14-ecdsa-depreciation-schedule-draft-8325a94b8952ac07c48c28294a068f33.png" width="873" height="410" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Up to 11 years to go, and that's <strong>if</strong> you depend on ECDSA and must use it. xx Chain <em>does not have to</em> use ECDSA signatures.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theqrl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web site</a> says the their chain uses XMSS, a NIST-approved post-quantum secure digital signature scheme.</p>
<p>Similarly to Ozone Chain (below), they use lattice-key storage.</p>
<p>QRL uses <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RandomX</a>, a proof of work (PoW) algorithm based on random code execution.</p>
<p>They claim two audits, by red4sec and x41 D-sec, which is very nice but also expensive. As I recall xx Network had one audit, in 2021, for example.</p>
<p>They have post-quantum addresses developed in-house, which xx Network also has (Sleeve, mentioned further below in the xx Network section).</p>
<p>In terms of plans, here's what they have on their site on next generation of QRL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>codenamed Zond, is introducing key features such as web3 compatibility and a proof-of-stake protocol with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract support. QRL Zond integrates post-quantum secure methods with Ethereum architecture, offering a secure platform for future applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EVM support is nice and PolkadotSDK chains can also run EVM in addition to its own native ecosystem with hundreds of applications, but that is not the focus of xx Network (cMixx is).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="opinion-on-qrl">Opinion on QRL<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily#opinion-on-qrl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Opinion on QRL" title="Direct link to Opinion on QRL">​</a></h3>
<p>With its focus on chain and wallets, QRL is a "PQ-Litecoin", if you will. Monero is also a PoW chain, I don't see that QRL focuses on privacy, so I changed that to "PQ-Litecoin".</p>
<p>Having Sleeve-like wallet generator and two audits is very helpful for coin-based use cases.</p>
<p>xx Network is a messaging forcused PQ project. Wallets (created with Sleeve) are PQ-secure and the chain itself is very likely going to become PQ-secure because Polkadot DAO is very well funded with a vibrant ecosystem (if you don't understand the value of PolkadotSDK to xx Chain, <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem">see this post</a>).</p>
<p>To summarize: QRL has some advantages over xx Chain, but they may not be sustainable. On the other hand, it has no meaningful applications except the coin itself, while xx Network focuses on PQ-mixnet services.</p>

<p>Ozone's QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests. That's nice.</p>
<p>Ozone claims three PQ-related features:</p>
<ul>
<li>QRNG - quantum process-based random number generator</li>
<li>QKD - quantum key distribution</li>
<li>PQC - post-quantum cryptography that uses lattice-based cryptography (whichis different from cMixx, for example). Resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure how QKD works and why they need it. It's a <a href="https://ozonechain.io/validator-node/#a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secret</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Setup quantum tunnels between your node and other nodes
Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, so is this a permissioned network as far as validation is concerned? Let's see (on the same page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new validator will be accepted by the network after a period of 6 hours mentioned by epochlength in the genesis file is passed and if it received the votes from a majority (above 50%) of existing validators within the 6 hours period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears to be permissioned because you can't become a candidate without the developers' help and once you do become a candidate, there's no market mechanism (such as NPoS on Substrate-based chains including xx Chain). NPoS isn't perfect, but this one is ... mysterious. You need to get permitted, and then lobby the existing validators to join in. That's strange, and maybe more "centralizing" than NPoS.</p>
<p>Also on the same page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>Setup quantum tunnels between your node and the newly created nodes
Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If Discord is down, you can't become a validator.</p>
<p>About PQC in Ozone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CRYSTALS-Kyber. CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) comprises two lattice-based cryptographic primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kyber, a CCA-secure KEM, and</li>
<li>Dilithium, a strongly EUF-CMA secure digital signature algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't comparable to xx Chain (see other comments about PolkadotSDK-based chains), which don't claim PQC, and <strong>users</strong> of xx Network's cMixx mixnet aren't directly impacted by lack of chain-level PQC.</p>

<p>Ozone's QRNG sounds like snake oil to me. You can read about it <a href="https://whitepaper.ozonechain.io/quantum-random-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The reason I say that is the illustration implies custom hardware, so unless everyone has one, these random numbers may be emitted from a centralized source ("Ozone Foundation" or some 3rd party <a href="https://random.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beacon</a>?). If it's centralized, it's not good.</p>

When it becomes necessary xx Chain will likely use a PQ DVRF such as Drand Bridge Pallet (if it's PQ or after it becomes PQ).</p></div></div>
<p>Ozone is EVM compatible and has half a dozen apps (DEX, memes, games) - all unrelated to what xx Network does.</p>
<p>My take: it's a PQ EVM platform on a small EVM-compatible chain. There are dozens of EVM-compatible chains that are larger and permissionless.</p>
<p>Ozone's transactions are currently around 4,000/day, while xx Chain has around 600 and many of them are nomination/validation-related, so it has to be said that xx Chain has very few transactions. Why is that?</p>
<p>The action on xx Network hapens on cMixx (mixnet), which is free to use and doesn't require any coins (XX or other). On the other hand, many of Ozone's transactions may be DEX and memecoin traffic.</p>
<p>Block times are 5 and 6 seconds, respectively, but in the case of xx Chain that's not realy pertinent to almost any relevant use case (as I've mentioned, the action is happening on cMixx).</p>

<p>This is the same thing as QANON... sorry, QANX: Ethereum with PQ patches.</p>
<p>xx Network isn't in PQ EVM or blockchain business, so there's noth much to compare, but aside from that, they don't have anything in place: it seems they're trying to ICO now, so they may be a year from a functioning decentralized mainnet, and even then they won't have anything similar to cMixx.</p>

<p>I saw a bunch of coins/chains mentioned in the thread. I checked five, and three of them were random shitposts pumping loser coins that have nothing in terms of PQ readiness.</p>
<p>Two I've heard of, and was able to find something PQ-related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorand (ALGO) - partially ready (uses FALCON), but VRF <a href="https://algorand.co/technology/post-quantum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is vulnerable</a> and will have to be swapped out (same as PolkadotSDK-based chains). No sign of PQ in wallets (addresses), though.</li>
<li>Hedera (HDR) - doesn't seem ready in any way. <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/post-quantum-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This post</a> explains that. No signs of any PQ features.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, they're very "L1-focused" (similar to the three coins higlighted by Altcoin Daily). Algorand's addresses and signatures may be in trouble and Hedera's probably, too.</p>
<p>In any case, they don't appear focused on PQ messaging, so who cares.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-network-xx">xx Network (XX)<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily#xx-network-xx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx Network (XX)" title="Direct link to xx Network (XX)">​</a></h2>
<p>First, each stack of xx Network should be separately analyzed. I'm not a cryptographer,</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-chain-xx-token">xx Chain (xx token)<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/14/top-pq-quantum-resistant-coins-altcoin-daily#xx-chain-xx-token" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx Chain (xx token)" title="Direct link to xx Chain (xx token)">​</a></h3>
<p>XX is the native token of xx chain.</p>
<p>xx Chain is a Substrate- (or, PolkadotSDK-based) chain which is PQ-ready. Whazzit mean?</p>
<p>It means that once PolkadotSDK <em>is</em> PQ-ready, xx Chain will be updated to be ready as well.</p>
<p>Does that means all PolkadotSDK chains will be PQ-ready? Not really.</p>
<p>xx Validators - and all who used <a href="https://sleeve.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleeve</a> have PQ-ready wallet addresses and PQ-ready wallet pass phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleeve ... derives the quantum-secure wallet, which is not currently used, but will be necessary in the future in order to rollover existing non quantum secure wallets into quantum secure wallets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleeve uses WOTS+ and has a defined path to upgrade the chain to support WOTS+ signatures in transactions and user accounts. From <a href="https://github.com/xxfoundation/sleeve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uses a WOTS+ key as the underlying quantum secure key. After the WOTS+ key is generated, we save the quantum secure public key (PK). This public key will be used as the Wallet address when full quantum secure capabilities are implemented in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sooo.... xx Network is in a very good place.</p>
<p>Do these other PQ coins have such wallets? As far as I can tell, QRL may have it. Those who don't won't become ready without migrating existing wallets.</p>
<p>Any non-PQ ready chains <strong>as well as</strong> PQ-ready without PQ addresses will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually move all assets to a new quantum secure wallet (address)</li>
<li>migrate blockchain signature system to WOTS+ (or similar)</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Chain wallets with Sleeve-generated wallets won't need to do any of this.</p>

<p>The real PQ action - and why xx Network probably shouldn't be compared with those coins - is in cMixx.</p>
<p>cMixx employs the following <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/design-specs/end_to_end" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptographic primitives</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.</li>

<li>Diffie–Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.</li>
<li>SIDH: Length of public key is 3024 bits. Quantum resistant component of key negotiation in theoriginal cMix. In <strong>cMixx</strong> (current implementation) SIDH was replaced by CSIDH.</li>

<p>I don't speak for xx Network, but based on what's happening now and what I think will happen in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>xx Chain is PQ-ready and will adopt PQ enhancements from PolkadotSDK which will surely come about. Some enhancements (such as provable decentralized randomness) are already available, it's just that they're not necessary</li>
<li>cMixx is the core service of xx Network and what sets it apart from these three coins. There are integrations for mixing wallet transactions (e.g. with Metamask), private and confidential ID lookups (Worldcoin) and Haven, a reference messaging platform. You can look at the current grants (on forum.xx.network) and see all of them are related to improving cMixx. One of</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't maintain this comparison, but see <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how Haven (and cMixx in general) compares against other encrypted messengers.</p>

<p>The Altcoin Daily post is meaningless. But obviously "it worked" because it made me spend time on writing this post.</p>
<p>While all three coins (CELL, OZO, QRL) have PQ-ready chains, from what I can see not all have PQ addresses.</p>
<p>Some have heavily centralized validation while others are backed by commercial entities (and therefore centralized). These factors present greater risks than CRQC.</p>
<p>None of them <strong>focus</strong> on messaging. Cellframe mentions it as a use case, but that's far from having anything usable and in production.</p>
<p>xx Network's blockchain is already sufficiently PQ-resistant, and given Polkadot DAO's resources, will be ready before it becomes important. xx Network addresses generated with Sleeve are considered secure.</p>
<p>xx Network's main service, cMixx, is also PQ-resistant. It's been in production for years (try <a href="https://haven.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network Haven here</a>), and has integrations unrelated to XX coin. In fact cMixx mixnet can be used for mixing wallet RPC calls of any coin (see Proxxy) and it can be done for free.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to blockchain, xx Network has PQ and other features that rival those three projects: some xx Chain features are much better, and others can be added by integrating the currently unused components of PolkadotSDK.</p>
<p>In terms of PQ features of the chain itself, those chains may be ahead, but they are bogged down in re-developing the same chain features that have been developed elsewhere, with a fraction of Polkadot DAO's resources that xx Network can use for free (and that's not "porting" the way some of these coins do with Ethereum's features, but the relatively simpler "enabling").</p>
<p>Regarding chain features, the three coins are ahead of other chains out there, but their problem can be summarized like so: aside from address readiness (which two seem to have), will other coins out there reach PQ before these coins reach their own escape velocity?</p>
<p>xx Network shouldn't be directly compared with them, but I think it's better in both ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain-wise, some PQ features are less developed, some same or better (Sleeve). But xx Network's non-PQ features are way ahead due to the use of PolkadotSDK and these cost relatively little to develop and advance</li>
<li>PQ services-wise, xx Network is focused on messaging and in that area ahead of all three. As for other services (unrelated to messaging mixnet), I think it's better to not focus on many - one use case is hard enough - so it doesn't bother me that cMixx can't do phone calls, or transfer files</li>

            <description><![CDATA[What was voted on, why, and who was against]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Recently xx Network held its 28th democracy referendum (referendum ID 27) on the topic of hiking the minimum validator stake to 15,000 XX and subsequently as required (and depending on market conditions and the price of xx token).</p>
<p>Currently it is 1,000 XX which is just $60 - totally laughable!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="how-did-we-get-here-and-why-this-hike-was-necessary">How did we get here and why this hike was necessary<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake#how-did-we-get-here-and-why-this-hike-was-necessary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did we get here and why this hike was necessary" title="Direct link to How did we get here and why this hike was necessary">​</a></h2>
<p>Originally the minimum validator stake was much higher (14,000 XX) and that was when the coin was several times more valuable. Now the minimum stake is 1/14 of the amount and 1/4 of the value, which means in fiat terms it's 1/64-th of what it was.</p>
<p>As usual, when it comes to bad decisions it's now unclear how "it was decided" to make the nonsense cut to 1,000 XX and who was/were the main supporter(s) of that when it was done.</p>
<p>But looking forward, it's easy to see that the current minimum validator stake doesn't make any sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes mockery out of NPOS. You can validate by staking $60</li>
<li>It's bad for security of the network. You can stand up 200 validators by staking just $12,000</li>
<li>It makes scamming easier for bad actors. You can stand up 30 validators with $1,800 and cycle through them and create new ones as you scam nominators on a different node every day</li>
<li>It's a tiny fraction of minimum validator stake elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Unbelievably, we still got a vote <em>against</em> the hike!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="who-was-against">Who was against?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/10/xx-referendum-id-27-min-validator-stake#who-was-against" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who was against?" title="Direct link to Who was against?">​</a></h2>
<p>Just <code>6ZFHpAxagxZV8E2GFyMEJoTgRvEsBgEh7vHMYSu6p7bLwufg</code>.</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://forum.xx.network/t/revised-increase-min-staking/7045/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> or on-chain: 114 in favor and 1 against.</p>
<p>Just one voter was against this common-sense change and - surprise, surprise - it's a wallet associated with the pool trash:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Wallet that voted against xx Network referendum ID 27" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-12-10-xx-network-min-validator-stake-referendum-f88d54402f1e7eb0c3fb5958999c103c.png" width="1182" height="377" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>To the uninitiated, this validator (<code>MONEYTEAM 04</code>) nominated by the dissenting wallet belongs to a centralized farming pool <code>MONEYTEAM</code> which should be pushed out (and that's something I look forward to in 2025).</p>
<p>The wallet that voted against may very well be the sockpuppet operator behind this pool.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the current joke of the minimum stake has made the network more vulnerable to such abuse (centralized farming and weakned cMixx security). Look at their stakes:</p>

<p>No wonder they were against! They'll need to stake their little farm with ~50K XX to survive beyond January 2025...</p>

<p><a href="https://supra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supra</a> launched and the process of token distribution was a mess. (The network itself is promising.)</p>
<p>Among the problems, one of the small ones was that many "airdrop" users weren't able to "claim" their $SUPRA because they couldn't pay for the transaction fee required to do that.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not really a problem: open a CEX account, buy $SUPRA and send it to your address. 15 minutes of easy labor.</p>
<p>But why work 15 minutes, solve your problem and put yourself in a position in which you can also help your fellow users (1), when you can beg for free in Supra Discord instead?</p>
<p>(1) By this I mean residents of countries who cannot open accounts in currently available CEXes. None of the current tax haven CEXes accept US account holders, for example.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="good-samaritans">Good Samaritans<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/08/good-samaritans-of-supra-network#good-samaritans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Good Samaritans" title="Direct link to Good Samaritans">​</a></h2>
<p>From an economics perspective, there are several interesting things about this.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="discord-admins">Discord admins<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/08/good-samaritans-of-supra-network#discord-admins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discord admins" title="Direct link to Discord admins">​</a></h3>
<p>Discord channel admins allowed begging, which is commonly banned everywhere because it doesn't add any value. It is also counterproductive because it adds noise, and doesn't help the project (whereas sending uses to CEXes does).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="community-members">Community members<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/08/good-samaritans-of-supra-network#community-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community members" title="Direct link to Community members">​</a></h3>
<p>First, I was suprised that relatively few people in Discord complained, but I think I know why: nobody bothers to read anything but their own threads and the lax moderation makes that worse becuase there's simply too many stupid posts in the channel (#general on the Supra Discord). At the same time, many are mad about the problems in the claim process, so the administrators can't be as strict as they should be.</p>
<p>Second, some users, like <a href="https://x.com/icryptosystem/status/1862307333998596214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">farmsenth.eth</a> on X, offer to send 1 $SUPRA for "free" to anyone, to help them claim tokens.</p>
<p>The Supra guys reposted that, but I <a href="https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1862378695790665822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented about this on X</a> saying it's a terrible idea that doesn't help Supra at all. Later I noticed a change - they started telling users to go to a CEX and buy $SUPRA - so looks like my feedback had some effect.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that feeding beggars just makes the problem worse because those who would reluctantly open a CEX account would decide to skip that and beg instead, seeing how it's allowed and works.</p>
<p>Third, there were two groups of people who didn't feed the beggars (as much):</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero-interest lenders: those who offered to lend 1 $SUPRA under the condition that the borrower pays back after they claim</li>
<li>Predatory profiteers: those who offered to lend at a profit. I belong to this group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="whos-the-bad-guy-here">Who's the bad guy here?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/08/good-samaritans-of-supra-network#whos-the-bad-guy-here" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who's the bad guy here?" title="Direct link to Who's the bad guy here?">​</a></h3>
<p>People like <strong>farmsenth.eth</strong> are the worst, for reasons explained above and in the tweet. In this group, the Discord account <strong>souravrockz</strong> (maybe the same guy, I haven't looked) is particularly active, using free $SUPRAs as a marketing tool for gathering followers for his airdrop platform. If that's not definition of spamming, I don't know what is. But they let him anyway. <strong>farmsenth.eth</strong> does the same on X, buys followers while making CEX partners lose customers they probably justifiably expected to win when they invested in marketing and launch activities.</p>
<p>The lenders are not as bad, although they too do the same disservice to the network because they decrease liquidity by helping users stay "inactive" as far as CEXes are involved.</p>

<p>Typical example: buying 1,000 <em>and then immediately selling 790</em> $SUPRA leaves you with 210 $SUPRA that you can send to your wallet. Early on (within a week from the launch) that was less than a $2 in "additional investment". But the pikers were relentless. Why buy 210 when I can beg for 1?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many supras in gas do I need to be able to claim bybit? It asks for a minimum purchase of 1000 supras. That is too much. Is there no way to get gas elsewhere?
~ beggar from Supra Discord</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profiteers such as I are less bad than the lenders because by asking to be compensated we discourage begging (since not all beggars want to pay more back).</p>
<p>I would prefer that beggars be banned or kicked so that there's no begging and everyone goes to CEX so that only a small minority (Americans and Europeans, mostly) asks for help. But begging is going on and the first two groups doing their thing, so I decided to participate using what I belive is the least bad approach.</p>
<p>Did it work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, when no one from the other two groups (donors and lenders) happens to be online</li>
<li>No, when someone from one or both groups offers to help out for free</li>
</ul>

<p>Is 500% interest per day predatory lending?</p>
<p>No, because it takes me minutes of work (copy, login, send, messaging) to do it and the "profit" was 8 $SUPRA (approximately 15 cents at the time) per customer.</p>
<p>That's not even US$ 9 per hour, so I worked for less than a minimum wage in the West while having capital at risk. Sorry, but I'm not sorry!</p>

<p>Another fun aspect of this has been profitability.</p>
<p>I've sent 2 $SUPRA to 4 people, each of whom agreed to pay me back 10 $SUPRA.</p>
<p>Only two paid back anything. From what I could tell, one was Chinese and one was American.</p>

<p>These two wallet owners weren't as nice. They agreed to receive 2 and pay back 10 (approximately $0.015 and $0.15, respectively, at the time) and failed to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://suprascan.io/address/0x699c017fe9b7112a98e58d9896eee3c8fc57ca985f161527c1aeeb491c2093b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x699c017fe9b7112a98e58d9896eee3c8fc57ca985f161527c1aeeb491c2093b7</a></li>

</ul>
<p>They didn't tell me why they didn't pay back, informed me why they couldn't, or told me about some delay or anything like that.</p>
<p>From my side, I didn't ask them if they maybe "forgot" about the deal, but I'll gladly link their wallets here.</p>
<p>Another guy dropped out "in presales stage" - he wanted just 1 $SUPRA (not 2, which was stupid since the assumption was he'd return both anyway), but didn't commit to returning any, so I disqualified him.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Wallets</th><th>Amount Sent</th><th>Amount Repaid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>2 $SUPRA</td><td>0 $SUPRA</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2 $SUPRA</td><td>20 $SUPRA</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The spammers and lenders did another 20-30 transactions that I saw (and probably 10x more when I wasn't looking), so one of my conclusions is certainly that people who really needed help were few.</p>
<p>The rest were simply lazy or outright scammers. Some probably didn't even have any $SUPRA to claim - they just wanted to profit from begging.</p>
<p>Since then $SUPRA went up a lot (it's $0.3 now), so I'd probably ask 2 $SUPRA in return for 5 $SUPRA at current prices. I'd ask for less, but given these levels of honesty it's hard to not lose money saving the world...</p>
<p>I expect that aidrop spammer guy will soon stop giving free $SUPRA for nothing and - given these lending losses - I think the not-for-profit lenders will also go away.</p>
<p>Only profiteers will remain in the game. The only way lending can always work.</p>

<p>I made more deals (2 for 10, 1 for 2, etc.) and helped one of those guys claim his tokens. Everyone was happy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access">Hacktoberfest 2024 PoC for token-gated access on xx Network</a> I wrote about restricting access to Web apps based on criteria such as the amount of XX token or kind and quantity of asset a wallet holds.</p>
<p>At the time I didn't look at NFTs, because they're not even exposed in xx Network wallet and I wasn't sure if those even worked.</p>
<p>Well, today I took a look and:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API is there and works</li>
<li>The official xx Network wallet indeed doesn't expose them in any way</li>
<li>NFT pallet in xx Chain code 0.2.6 is based on pallet-nfts v4.0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in theory at least, it should be possible to use them as long as you have your own application or don't need a Web UI.</p>
<p>I decided to spend some time on that this afternoon.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="nft-concepts">NFT concepts<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network#nft-concepts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NFT concepts" title="Direct link to NFT concepts">​</a></h2>
<p>It's a Substrate thing, similar across different chains. Note that some are more advanced and NFT-focused, and there you can do a lot more.</p>
<ul>
<li>NFTs come in "collections". A collection is identified by an ID, and has a bunch of properties</li>
<li>Each NFT belongs to a collection. Example: collection ID 10 may have NFTs ID 1, 2, and 3</li>
<li>NFTs can be minted, priced, transferred, bought, burned. Soul Bound NFTs are those that cannot be transferred once they're minted to a wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>On xx Network, since there's no user-facing Web UI where you can see anything. There's a simple "NFT" page that's always empty and doesn't show any collections or holdings, which is confusing. You can own, but can't see if you own any collections or NFTs.</p>

<p>These are "admin" level actions for the issuer.</p>
<ul>
<li>destroy: Destroy a collection. This destroys all the items inside the collection and refunds the deposit</li>
<li>force_mint: Mint a new item within a collection</li>
<li>burn: Destroy an item within a collection</li>

<p>Also "admin" level operations for the issuer, mostly related to "override" operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new collection (the collection ID can not be chosen)</li>
<li>Change collection's owner or configuration</li>
<li>Set an attribute</li>

<p>To make my life less miserable:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got two wallets (addresses), and created on-chain ID for the "NFT issuer" wallet</li>
<li>I got around 150 XX handy (20 XX for on-chain ID for the "NFT issuer", 100 as collection (issuance) deposit for one NFT collection, 10 for each NFT (I issued two))</li>
</ul>
<p>As wallet addresses are hard to remember, let's say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuer: ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet (<code>6Z...</code>)</li>
<li>Buyer: The-Dude aka "six-ace" (<code>6aCE...</code>)</li>

<p>I then used ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet to create another NFT for own wallet (ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet). That worked, but when I tried to transfer it to The-Dude, that wasn't possible (<code>nfts.transfer</code>). More on this later.</p>

<p>If the collection allows it, <em>item</em> properties can be changed later (<code>nfts.setMetadata</code>). This is for when we want to "customize" NFTs before making them available for sale or sending them to recepients. (Reference: <a href="https://wallet.xx.network/#/explorer/query/0x94bcd691323722d70c29b8e194beb60a719d98ced15fbd8899f07741e5043e2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extrinsic</a>)</p>

<p>You can also set a <em>custom</em> NFT item price to particular account. Earlier we set it to 1 XX, but you can override it like so.</p>

<p>Here's an example of quantity discount - the first item is 1 XX (default price, also in the screenshot above), but item ID 2 from collection ID 0 is available at half the price (0.5 XX).</p>

<p>Notice this price is available only for The-Dude wallet (a "whitelisted" buyer, in the screenshot), because it's specifically called out in that extrinsic (<code>ntfs.setPrice</code>).</p>

<p>So far, this is what I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet creates a collection with the ID 0, up to 500 of them, priced at 1 XX</li>
<li>ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet mints two NFTs (IDs 1 and 2):<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>ID 1 minted to The-Dude</li>
<li>ID 2 issued to himself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ArmchairAncap-Test-Wallet plays with settings, and makes just one big change - creates a year-end special for The-Dude: sets the price of NFT ID 2 to 0.5 XX</li>
</ul>
<p>What's minted to others gets "sent" to those wallets right away.</p>
<p>When issuer only can mint, what's issued to self seemingly cannot be bought without the issuer's specific "offer" to a 3rd party wallet such as The-Dude. I haven't verified this, but it seems that's how it works.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="buy-an-nft">Buy an NFT<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network#buy-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Buy an NFT" title="Direct link to Buy an NFT">​</a></h3>
<p>And the last screenshot shows how to buy that NFT ID 2 from the issuer who made it 50% cheaper than other items in the collection, so The-Dude buys it.

<p>I haven't tried using the API, but buying that NFT item for 0.5 XX would go similar to this:</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-can-we-do-with-nfts">What can we do with NFTs?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network#what-can-we-do-with-nfts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What can we do with NFTs?" title="Direct link to What can we do with NFTs?">​</a></h2>
<p>Many of the things everyone else does.</p>
<p>See that <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network">post on token-gated access</a> for some ides as well as the PoC app and its source code.</p>
<p>Personally, now that I know this API works and how it compares to xx Chain assets, I think NFTs are even better for mebership- and subscription-like use cases than assets!</p>
<p>There's no need to buy NFTs "off the market" like assets, which is a major advantage. You can also set discounts, named buyers, and more.</p>
<p>I'm not interested in popular NFT use cases (memecoins, games and such), so the fact that the xx Network Wallet has nothing for that doesn't bother me at all. xx Network assets are much better in this regard - you can see which assets exists, and how holds how many - but doing anything with them is difficult and especially buying and selling.</p>
<p>Other chains may have a more advanced NFT pallet, but I'd say xx Chain doesn't even need those newer pallet. Other chains need apps that use NFTs, but xx Chain already has a good one - it's called Haven.</p>
<p>While one may NFT-gate a Web site, you can't NFT-gate a Haven channel because the same channel (Space) can be accessed from any instance. But: we can <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/28/xx-validators-shall-we-play-a-game">ask Haven users to sign their wallet address</a> using their wallet, and then easily check if the user owns an NFT (or some quantity of an xx Network asset).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="next-steps">Next steps<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next steps" title="Direct link to Next steps">​</a></h2>
<p>xx Chain can do a lot more with NFTs than the spartan UI suggests - it's more than enough for some very interesting use cases.</p>
<p>It's shocking that no one has done anything with these so far, in over 1100 days since the chain launched.</p>
<p>Some items for potential future work:</p>
<ul>
<li>NFT-gated access: expand that PoC project with NFTs to have everything covered (XX coins, xx assets, and xx NFTs)</li>
<li>Other: I have ideas for several interesting use cases where I'd like to combine this with xx Network Haven communities. More on this in a future post</li>
<li>Low priority: check detailed collection settings and intermediate/advanced NFT workflows with approvals and more. Some of this may be useful even for non-memecoin use cases</li>

<p>xx Network has a small, but growing number of nodes owned by centralized entities ("pools"). As far as I can tell most Substrate-based chains do.</p>
<p>I happen to care about xx Network and I don't think we should have <em>anyone</em> control more nodes than the current cMixx round size (which is five).</p>
<p>There are variuos measures the xx Network Council has initiated to protect enhance decentralization, but as a demonstration of a working decentralized approach I'm willing to spend some of my XX coins to make a point.</p>

<p>This is only loosely related, but: did you know that Polkadot has a community event called <a href="https://polkadot.com/spammening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Spammering"</a> that is about to happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spammening, Polkadot’s ultimate stress test!</p>
<p>Polkadot is about to be put to the test as we push it to its limits in real-time. Get ready to witness the network’s resilience and scalability under extreme load as we #RekTheMeter!</p>

<p>That IPv4 address will belong to a pool node identified by the cMix ID.</p>
<p>The cMix ID will be shared 3-4 hours before the era begins so that you have time to find and block the IP (which takes mere seconds - <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/28/xx-validators-shall-we-play-a-game#how-to-block-and-unblock-an-ip-address">see below</a>).</p>

<p>You will get <strong>over 100% of your normal validator reward</strong> if you successfully complete the mission. Those who partially (&gt;50% failure rate) succeed will also get rewarded, but less.</p>
<p>Assumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>You make 40 XX in most recent era directly preceding the game era(s) (era 1106)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Assumption: node earnings 182 XX x 22% (maximum validator commission acceptable for this game)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of earnings for two outcomes with rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validator successfully fails <strong>100% of cMixx rounds with the target</strong> during the game<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Due to these failures you make 30 XX in the era (lose 10 XX, (40 - 30)). I will compensate you for the 10 XX</li>
<li>You will receive a separate bonus of 100% of your earnings from the previous era (40 XX * 100%)</li>
<li>My net payment to your address: <strong>50 XX</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validator fails <strong>between 50%+1 and less than 100%</strong> of the rounds shared with the target<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Due to less failures than the more successful players, drop in earnings is maybe just 5 XX (40-35)</li>
<li>I will compensate you for the 5 XX and pay 40% of the earnings from previous era: (40 - 35) + (40 x 40%)</li>
<li>My net payment to your address: <strong>21 XX</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validator participates but is incompetent and doesnt' hit &gt; 50% failure rate<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>They may lose 2-3 XX ("small success") or nothing (ineffective application of firewall rules)</li>
<li>They get no compensation and no reward, so if you can't take the risk just join the chat</li>
<li>I may compensate their nominators depending on the type and extent of screw-up (stupid screwups - no compensation)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Example of a stupid scrweup: you block IP address of the cMixx permissioning server instead of the cMixx ID you're supposed to</li>

<p>Separately, I will <em>compensate all of your nominators</em> for the difference (drop) in rewards for the era compared to the previous era.</p>
<p>Additional rewards may be dispensed depending on effectiveness of the game and if less than 10 validators participate in era 1107, the game will continue into era 1108 and I may increase rewards for the remaining slots in era 1108.</p>

<p>The payout will happen within three eras after the game era. Why so long?</p>
<p>Because I need to check thousands of rounds of the target node and make sure that participating validators have not participated in any of the successful ones. That will take time.</p>
<p>I plan to write a script that checks all rounds or (worst case) manually check a sufficiently big ample of the target's <strong>successful</strong> rounds and verify that each participant's node has failed more than 50% or all 100% of them in during the era.</p>
<p>Chat rewards will be dispensed promptly.</p>

<li>Validators: sign your node's validator's (not controller's) wallet address. From that I can see your cMixx ID for the game era, and check if meet the qualifying criteria. Validators are automatically qualified for chat rewards</li>

<p>Rounds in which the blocked IP participates would fail due to pre-comp timeout. Other rounds will work fine.</p>
<p>If your node was to fail 20% of the rounds, you'd make close to 20% less, i.e. your validator earnings would drop by almost 20% of your commission (assuming your commission is 22% that would be 22% - (20% x 22%) or a drop of less than 5 XX).</p>

<p>There are several potential targets, so they're unlikely to watch our Space and change IP address before or during our little game. If they do, though, let's consider some scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>the target changes their IP address <em>before</em> beginning of the era: nothing changes for us. You may want to delete the outdated firewall rule and create a new one, and still earn partial rewards even if you do that hours into the game era - you just need to fail more than 50% of common rounds shared with the target</li>
<li>the target changes their IP address <em>after</em> beginning of the game era: my reward criteria will likely be loosened, but you can still modify your firewall rules to make more<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>if they change the node IP eight hours into an era and you update your rule 10 hours into an era, you can still meet the objective for more than 50% of the rounds and get the second tier reward</li>
<li>if they change several times during the game era (which I can check in my own logs), rewards will be prorated for the longest stretch (e.g. 6 hours) between two changes will be considered. In that case your node would make normal earnings for 24-6 hours (as blocking would fail), and I'd pay out a quarter (6/24 hours) of rewards. For six hours of successful blocking on a node that made 50 XX in that era, I'd reward you 50 x (1/4) x 100% (12.5 XX) if all of your rounds shared with the target during those six hours failed</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>In the era before the game, your node earns 190 XX. In the era, if you do well your node will earn less, let's say 160 XX.</p>
<p>I will compensate your nominators for that difference (which would be (190 x 22%) - (160 x 22%)).</p>
<p>I will check every winner's nominators in the game era and send each nominator their ideal share of the loss. For example: if a nominator has 30% of all nominations, they'll get 30% of 6.6 XX (total drop of nominators' earnings after validator's commission is deducted).</p>

<p>It is to estimate the effect (reward reduction for bad actors and their nominators) and costs (drop in rewards for the rest of us) of a community action like this. It's a special take on Polkadot's spammering, so to speak.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like the community to be able to hurt pools in a cost-effective fashion.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the network can use formal measures by the Council or democracy vote, but voluntary community action is vastly superior to that approach.</p>

<p>I'm going to turn a few thoughts into a blog post because it should be on the Internet and stay there for a while. (Ironically, this won't be published <em>soon</em> as I'm still waiting for Github to tell me what I did to have my account suspended - but more on that once I find out!)</p>
<p>Claim: very few xx Network community members realize or highlight opportunities related to the fact that xx Network uses a Substrate-based chain.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> article, there's over 300 projects in the Polkadot SDK-based ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-matters-and-what-doesnt">What matters and what doesn't<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#what-matters-and-what-doesnt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What matters and what doesn't" title="Direct link to What matters and what doesn't">​</a></h2>
<p>Dr. Chaum and the Team behind xx Network are well aware of the benefits of having a Substrate-based chain, but years after the launch 90% of community members are still mesmerized and distracted by the peripheral stuff.</p>
<p>What's periferal stuff?</p>
<p>It's both old and new things - the BIS/CBDC trials, the Charles Hutchison-Trump administration thing, digital voting in government-organized elections...</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="why-care-about-the-polkadot-ecosystem">Why care about the Polkadot ecosystem?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#why-care-about-the-polkadot-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why care about the Polkadot ecosystem?" title="Direct link to Why care about the Polkadot ecosystem?">​</a></h2>
<p>The Team of course knows the value of Polkadot ecosystem which is why they picked a Substrate-based chain.</p>
<p>But if one looks at what most people in the community are paying attention to, most don't appear to see it. They're blinded by the seeming ease of scoring bigly, or simply too lazy to learn about the less obvious opportunities, and so they tirelessly look in the wrong places.</p>
<p>Such as? Various quantum computing news, the Charles/Trump thing, rumored crypto payments on X, etc.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note admonition_UIiK alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonitionHeading_WVRp"><span class="admonitionIcon_lTvr"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent__ZrN"><p>The obsession about quantum computing news is very strange to me.</p><p>On the one hand, that's one of two main things in cMixx (the other is that it's a mixnet). The threat is real, it is now ("Harvest now, decrypt later"). But it's one thing to mention it, and another to obsess about quantum computing-related news and ignore almost everything else.</p><p>Or worse, to think that some government will use cMixx because it uses PQC. This week I skimmed through some EU-originated PQC work and they're happily researching their own and plan to get it done in the late 20s. Why would they use cMixx when it could make them redundant? It's no different in any other country or union.</p></div></div>
<p>It is true that Dr. Chaum himself has participated in BIS/CBDC-related research and evaluations, but that's because he should. I wouldn't expect, or want him to build embedded wallets. He is focused on the tech behind cMixx and the best evagelist and promoter we have.</p>
<p>But the opportunities that Polkadot SDK offers to xx Network are many and significant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>approachable</strong>: they're suitable for community and developer engagement. You and that dApp developer you know don't need a PhD in cryptography or deep understanding of the workings of central banks in order to use cMixx and xx Chain to create useful and practical solutions today</li>
<li><strong>immediate</strong>: some of my ideas for dDpps require mere days to develop and launch. I know because I've done some simple ones myself. They don't take quarters to discuss and years to develop, trial and put in production. You don't need to look for "investors" to fund their development. Imagine &amp; implement!</li>
<li><strong>low-cost</strong>: in some cases, 7 engineer days to users and maybe even revenue</li>
<li><strong>permissionless</strong>: these opportunities are real and don't depend on anyone reaching out to Elon or some political figure doing us a favor (or even realizing that it'd be us doing them a favor)</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but hodlers are doing themselves disservice looking for opportunities in the wrong places.</p>
<p>How hard is it to realize that fiat currencies aren't meant to be transparent, decentralized or private? It seems very. It won't happen.</p>
<p>Yes, cMixx <em>should</em> be trialed with the BIS and central banks. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>to show that it won't happen despite the tech being there. In other words, to expose central banks and governments so that everyone can see that it's not about technical challenges, "the tech not being there" or whatever other excuse they come up with</li>
<li>to scientifically and practically prove that xx Network can do this for private/permissionless use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm convinced 95% of people in the xx Network community don't realize or disagree with the above two points. But these are the key points when it comes to choosing where to engage and contribute (especially since most of us neither connected nor <em>qualified</em> to contribute - and no, asking "wen" doesn't count).</p>
<p>If anything, post-quantum mixnets <strong>may be</strong> implemented by central banks and governments, but in order <em>to hide</em> their own inner workings from taxpayers and public debt investors.</p>
<p>In other words, they may implement them to hide and obfuscate transactions between central banks or between central banks and private banks with whom they do business. It won't be on xx Network or any other public mixnet or chain. Got it?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-opportunities-are-there">What opportunities are there?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#what-opportunities-are-there" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What opportunities are there?" title="Direct link to What opportunities are there?">​</a></h2>
<p>I hope I shouldn't need to explain, but given the visual impairedness of many in the community, I'll mention several examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>My recent posts on dApps and Hacktoberfest 2024 wins give some concrete examples</li>
<li>Other opportunities (high-level only, as I may try to realize some of them):<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Most Substrate-based (aka Polkadot SDK-based) wallets can access xx Chain</li>
<li>All xx Chain addressses are valid on <em>almost every</em> Substrate-based chain</li>
<li>Almost all Polkadot-related projects could use xx Chain and make use of cMixx (xx Network mixnet service)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll explore each of these claims, but feel free to skim through them if you understood what I meant to say.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-coin-in-substrate-walelts">xx coin in Substrate walelts<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#xx-coin-in-substrate-walelts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx coin in Substrate walelts" title="Direct link to xx coin in Substrate walelts">​</a></h3>
<p>If one has "a" Substrate based wallet, they can likely use it to hold xx coin.</p>
<p>Not a big deal, there are many wallets that work with multiple chains, right?</p>
<p>Yes, but you have to pick a wallet that supports two or more coins that you have which in many cases means some L2 and therefore L1 - often Ethereum, which has been stagnant. Sometimes, if you use two L2s, you may need <em>two</em> Ethereum wallets. Or maybe three if you also use another chain. Oops!</p>

Because of that, two months ago I put a small amount of fiat into some other, newer L1 networks and they've done very well (relative to both ETH and BTC).</p><p>Also importantly, I do think coins and L1/L2's are fungible in the mid- to long-term, so what's modern and superior today may not be five years down the road. It depends on the innovation, development, etc.</p><p>And finally, much of my crypto is in XX token and do not encourage anyone to buy any crypto token.</p><p>All this is just FYI to may clear I'm not pumping any coin or network here.</p></div></div>
<p>For bitcoiners, it's even worse because there's barely anything going on there in terms of useful decentralized applications. Anyone who uses crypto (rather than keep their BTC parked and watch the number go up and down) needs wallet one for Bitcoin and several for other useful apps (other L1/L2 chains).</p>
<p>In the Polkadot ecosystem, there are <em>many</em> good L1 <em>and</em> L2 chains and apps. You usually need just one wallet to access all your tokens and NFTs. You may not be able to <em>use an app</em> from the wallet if the wallet doesn't offer integration with the app, but you'll see your coin in almost any wallet for Substrate-bsed chains.</p>
<p>That makes it easy to own XX token and enables cross-polination across Substrate-based networks.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="universal-polkadot-addresses">Universal Polkadot addresses<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#universal-polkadot-addresses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Universal Polkadot addresses" title="Direct link to Universal Polkadot addresses">​</a></h3>
<p>That first statement about xx Chain adddresses being the same across all Substrate chains isn't entirely correct as stated above - that was purposedly simplified.</p>
<p>What's valid across most Substrate chains is your regular wallet pass phrase and private key(s). SS58 addresses are different for every chain, but can be derived from the same pass phrase or private key(s).</p>
<p>Why should we care? Because you can have a Substrate wallet that uses a <em>single</em> pass phrase for (probably) <em>any dApp</em> in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consider this simple pitch from <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SubWallet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manage multiple seed phrases with only one master password. SubWallet supports 150+ networks, 450+ tokens, and 80+ dApps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An xx Network address looks differently from its Polkadot "representation", but these are - and must be, to prevent confusion and loss - because these are different SS58 networks. That is amazing.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-chain-can-integrate-with-many-polkadot-projects">xx chain can integrate with many Polkadot projects<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#xx-chain-can-integrate-with-many-polkadot-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx chain can integrate with many Polkadot projects" title="Direct link to xx chain can integrate with many Polkadot projects">​</a></h3>
<p>Because of the two earlier points, Substrate L1 and L2 chains and apps can be easily interconnected.</p>
<p>What if I use Kusama and need to pay for cMixx "postage" (i.e. "premium" service tier, <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage">once xxPostage becomes available</a>)?</p>
<p>I'll need only one wallet, just one pass phrase, KSM (tokens) and the ability to buy and sell XX tokens on a DEX to pay for "postage" on xx Network. cMixx postage hasn't been implemented yet, but the only thing that's missing is the ability to buy/sell XX coin with KSM which is technically possible today (e.g. see <a href="https://hydration.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydration</a>) and only a matter of making a small-to-moderate implementation effort.</p>
<p>What if I use XX token and want to use for some non-zero cost service on one of the many Substrate-based chains?</p>
<p>The same thing - one wallet, one pass phrase, and the ability to buy/sell other Substrate tokens - directly or indirectly (e.g. sell XX token to buy DOT or KSM, then sell DOT or KSM to buy the Substrate L1 token you need).</p>
<p>Until direct or indirect on-Substrate-chain DEXes that support XX token become available, one can still do this by using a DEX outside of the Substrate chain ecosystem, but for that we need a wallet that supports said DEX. At this time the easiest way to buy/sell in either direction would be to use a DEX and Ethereum-based wrapped XX coin. That's not perfectly convenient, but at least it doesn't require much overhead - it takes minutes at most.</p>
<p>For free services on Substrate-based entworks (where there's no need for buying and selling) - you can access them as soon as they're implemented. For example, the <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access">token- and asset-gated acces</a> demo app only requires ocassional, potentially one-time transfer or transaction and you're good to go for months if not years. Some don't require any, for example in the case a site lets you access it with <em>any</em> Substrate-based token, as long as the USD equivalent of your balance is more than 10 dollars.</p>

<p>In addition to the dApps I wrote about recently, I want to highlight one opportunity which I thought was real, and that was to evangelize and popularize the integration with Crust Network, a Substate-based network storage project.</p>
<p>xx Network added a Curst Network files app to the official xx Network wallet, but most people didn't pay attention or didn't want to think about it, so the feature wasn't maintained or improved and now it doesn't work (it appears Crust Network no longer maintains that pallet/API).</p>
<p>Crust Network isn't equally private and post-quantum resistant, but it's convenient and not less private that 99% of other chat apps let you upload "attachments" or inline images.</p>
<p>What if the idea didn't make any sense? Was it practical and usable at all? I've no doubt it was.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text - and Crust Network download links - go to cMixx</li>
<li>Blobs (memes, audio clips, etc) go to Crust Network storage nodes and can be downloaded or shown inline in cMixx chat app</li>
</ul>
<p>You lose some privacy for such binary data, but that's a low-cost tradeoff. In return we could have had "unlimited" size attachments in cMixx chat apps for 2 years now. But no one showed much interest and we still don't have that feature in Haven today.</p>
<p>While Crust Network is now out of the focus due to low interest, similar opportunities abound so I know what I'll do - I'll be looking at other opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem because they're approachable, immediate, low-cost and permissionless.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.xx.network/dapps/proxxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxxy</a> is another low-hanging fruit. As a reminder, it proxies chain RPC calls through cMixx, which means once <em>a</em> Substrate-based chain becomes supported by Proxxy, many Substrate chains could be supported within days. xx Network's cMixx mixnet is free to use and there's 300 projects that could add this "enhanced privacy" feature easily. And maybe just four-five wallets would have to be enabled to add this feature to hundreds of Polkadot SDK-based projects, to put it another way and tie with those earlire points mentioned above.</p>
<p>Proxxy originally focused on Ethereum wallets and just like with Crust Network integration, the community thought it's better to focus on those "high-profile" use cases I find unlikely to happen. I think Proxy should focus on Substrate-based chains instead.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="take-aways">Take-aways<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem#take-aways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Take-aways" title="Direct link to Take-aways">​</a></h2>
<p>Many dApps from the Polkadot ecosystem could be used directly from xx Chain wallet and many Substrate chains could have a privacy setting that flips their wallet RPC transactions to use cMixx even if they don't pay for it with xx coin. That works today.</p>
<p>The lack of a mobile Haven client - once XX Messenger was discontinued  - has been hindering such dApps and integrations, but thanks to one of the winners of Hacktoberfest 2024 now we have a responsive Haven application that works from Android clients. It doesn't work <em>great</em> (it's not power-efficient on mobile - those improvements need to be added), but it works. If your mobile device connects to cMixx periodically - for example to download notifications or batch-upload data - there's no problem to do that on Android today.</p>
<p>If we look in the right places, and those places are <em>not</em> in central banks or governments, opportunities are plenty. Take a look at <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this State of Polkadot</a> report to understand this better.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing - and maybe even creating some related PoCs - some cool Polkadot ecosystem integrations happen in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://git.xx.network/carback1/xxblockdumper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xxblockdumper</a> is another nice utility from Rick.</p>
<p>It aims to provide the following features to xx chain users (from current repo description):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch complete block data from any Substrate-based chain</li>
<li>Retrieve state data and extrinsics</li>
<li>Export data to JSON format</li>
<li>Support for latest or specific block numbers</li>
<li>Configurable node endpoint</li>
<li>Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff</li>
</ul>

<p>Download, install, use.</p>
<p>Three comments regarding today's <code>main</code> tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently <code>click.echo(f"Debug - Block structure: {json.dumps(block, indent=2)}", err=True)</code> causes SCALE codec malfunction, so I mark it out before installing (this will probably get fixed soon)</li>
<li>I've updated some packages before installing, including Python Substrate Interface and SCALE codec, but this will probably be updated in <code>main</code> soon</li>
<li><code>-n ${BLOCKNUMBER}</code> is optional and <code>None</code> means <code>CURRENT</code></li>
<li>You may see this error as well</li>

<p>Output file name is currently hard-coded (<code>block_&lt;number&gt;_&lt;timestamp&gt;.json</code>) because xxblockdumper was created to enable simple DIY auditing of individual blocks.</p>
<p>In my case it was saved to <code>./dumps/block_15567031_20241110_155449.json</code>.</p>
<p>What does that dump file look like? Like this. 52 MB JSON in this particular case.</p>

<p>It means you get detailed chain info off your xx chain server in the convenient JSON format.</p>
<p>It means you can use this for certain things without having a big chain explorer at your disposal.</p>
<p>It means you may not be able to react as quickly as by API-querying an explorer - as you can see, it takes a bit more than 6 seconds to get this stuff out of your RPC endpoint.</p>
<p>If not all data are requested, it may be possible to provide near-real-time watch services (for example), but I haven't verified this - I just imagine if a fraction of data is required, certain queries could be done in seconds.</p>
<p>On a fast server we could run multiple xxblockdumper tasks, but as long as each task takes more than 6 seconds to get data and analyze it, that can't work for near-real-time analytics - for that you'd need a different tool.</p>
<p>If you want to dump details of old block data you'll need to run your node in archive mode and have &gt; 200 GB of disk space to play with. Nodes discard state fairly quickly depending on settings (minutes or hours).</p>
<p>For example, my dump file above contained many entries like these:</p>
<div class="language-raw codeBlockContainer_ecHN theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_Zx4T"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-raw codeBlock_fJJu thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_AmI_"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">"Error fetching storage: </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">{</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    'code': -32000, </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    'message': 'Client error: UnknownBlock: State already discarded for 0x463b0a5145b3a2b5b8d10e5572122a554f0eb9772712a787b4a6ffd2edc1f2a0'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">}"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_CiR6"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_ldCF" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_gU9M"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_cntW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>In order for xxblockdumper to work you need an archive node.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you look for current or very recent blocks and have a fast system, but state pruning timeout is 256 blocks, so for 1 hour you'd need (60s/6bps)x60 min= 600 at least.</p>

<p>xx Network has a mixnet (which in turn has an SDK called xxDK) which applications use to work with cMixx.</p>
<p>xx chain is a Polkadot SDK-based (aka Substrate-based) chain which has its own ecosystem, libraries, API.</p>
<p>Applications can use xxDK to send messages on xx Network for free, so there's no need to write to xx chain or own XX coins. It is expected that only power-users <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#postage">may have</a> the need to buy XX coin to pay, which is to say casual use should never require anything but xxDK.</p>
<p>What does that mean for dApp authors? I think that means xx Network is a good platform for messaging dApps.</p>

<p>Usually the fact that xx Network is "bootstrapped" in a blockchain elicits negative comments (see <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/06/06/xx-network-client-switches-to-pq-ctidh#techloretech">these examples</a>), if any at all.</p>
<p>Most people have no opinion about that, which isn't much better. It's a major difference and has to be considered. If you have good reasons why being blockchain-based is bad, that's fine as well.</p>
<p>I think it has a very positive impact that may not be obvious if you haven't thought about it and all you've heard is "crypto is full of scams".</p>
<p>For example, I happen to think that xx Network (and the Foundation) has a better setup than Signal and their foundation. Let's take a look at some more practical differences between xx Network and chainless apps.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="feature-full-native-chain">Feature-full native chain<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps#feature-full-native-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feature-full native chain" title="Direct link to Feature-full native chain">​</a></h3>
<p>xx Network is are one of very few networks that provide anonymous messaging <em>and</em> have its own L1 chain to work with.</p>
<p>xx Network has a <em>good</em> (Substrate-based), fast, low-cost chain with plenty of features - from assets to governance - so for many use cases entire apps can be written to it without using anything else.</p>
<p>Most other decentralized private messaging guys have to write dApps for 3rd party chains - which we can do, too - and we do not. More choice.</p>
<p>The PoC code for <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2023/11/05/xx-network-asset-gated-access/">XX token- and asset-gating</a> of Web sites shows how easy Polkadot-style dApps can work with xx Network - it wasn't too hard to modify the app for xx Network and add asset-gating. It would also be easy to modify that code to use asset-gating on other Substrate-based channels with asset support.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="native-currency">Native currency<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps#native-currency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Native currency" title="Direct link to Native currency">​</a></h3>
<p>Most other private messaging apps don't have a native currency, so they have to pick a wallet and integrate with another chain.</p>
<p>xxDK dApps can do that as well, but it's simple enough to use xx chain, especially if you need to handle postage that I mentioned earlier - in that case your app may be able to use one wallet and one currency.</p>
<p>Once XX coin gets listed on a DEX, it will be easy to acquire XX coin with any major crypto-currency and use it to pay postage (when it becomes available), so using xxDK from a dApp that defaults to other coins isn't any different from using other similar networks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="use-cases-for-these-building-blocks">Use cases for these building blocks<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps#use-cases-for-these-building-blocks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use cases for these building blocks" title="Direct link to Use cases for these building blocks">​</a></h2>
<p>I mentioned some of them in the token-gating post, but I'll make one additional example here to illustrate why I worked on those "building blocks" recently - we can put them together to build some simple dApps (or semi-dApps).</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to download a file, but if you need to do it reasonably privately, you can use <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler#whats-tribler">Tribler</a>
<ul>
<li>The challenge is getting the link equally (or more) privately</li>
<li>Find me in my Haven Space, pay me some coins, and I'll seed the file for you in Tribler (and give you the link). I can automate this completely as I explained in the Hacktoberfest post, or I can make it fully manual (which is necessary for on-demand items), semi-automated, or AI-powered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you need even more privacy for downloads, you can park them on S3 and use an asset-gated Web site in the public cloud</li>
<li>If you need even more privacy, you can run <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not#how-it-could-be-done">xx Haven container and Web service on Onion network</a></li>
<li>If you want to use a Web3 app without using public cloud, you can create an app that uses xxDK for chat and something like Crust Network to share content</li>
</ul>
<p>With XX chain (or other Substrate-chain) asset-gating we an even serve the same content using <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/polkadot-js-tokengated-website/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different routes (links) for different membership levels</a> all on xx Network.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="is-that-legal">Is that legal<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/11/xx-dapps#is-that-legal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is that legal" title="Direct link to Is that legal">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, some will inevitably think "crypto is only good for scams and crime".</p>
<p>I wouldn't be posting about this if I couldn't think of a lawful use case.</p>
<p>There are valid use cases for rare or unique data that can't be free (because it may require 100s of GBs in egress bandwidth).</p>
<p>There are dApps that specialize in blobs (Storj, etc.), but there are use cases where data has to be posted on demand.</p>
<p>In other cases you may not want to charge for egress in dApp, so you could use Tribler. Or you may want to speed up seeding in an ad-hoc manner, which is very easy to do in a community-powered way. Put a file on Tribler, share the link in a Haven space and ask everyone to help out:</p>
<ul>
<li>no crypto-currency involved</li>
<li>zero barrier to entry - one free app to install (Tribler), no wallet to create, no DEX/CEX or any registration to use</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it's not at all true there are no lawful use cases here.</p>
<p>xxNetwork cMixx is used mostly to share links or other metadata that benefits from its PQE and mixnet. It could be used for paid access to low-bandwidth data feeds, but I did not consider such use cases in this post.</p>
<p>Legal uses with P2P payments are also possible. In xx Network validator community there have been multiple occasions where people needed to download a copy of xx Chain faster than xx Chain could download it on its own: if you don't get ready by next validator election deadline you may not get elected and lose 50 XX by not validating, so paying 25 XX to get it faster would have saved validators money.</p>
<p>Storj egress is $0.007/GB, so 200GB is $1.4, and about $0.8 to upload. $2.2 is still very cheap, but with some friction for both sides (Storj account setup, payment, setup).</p>
<p>Haven-Tribler:</p>

<p>If they were Solana validators they would pay with Solana because that's what they already have ready to go. That doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>So we have everything you need and there's no need to use any other network, right?</p>
<p>Wrong! I'm not an XX coin maximalist, folks.</p>
<p>I'd never "encourage" you to use or buy XX coin. If you - a user or developer - think that it would help you, use it.</p>
<p>I only want to share why I think xx Network mixnet is quite unique in its approach. It does give you more flexibility and more convenience.</p>
<p>Anyone can build for xxDK and use (or not) whatever crypto currency they like in their dApp. They can also use several - for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>some currency which is their first choice</li>
<li>XX coin for xx Postage</li>
<li>Crust for blob storage</li>
<li>Ethereum for ENS (name and reputation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any permutation of these will work, and not having any coin will also work (Haven + Tribler, for example).</p>
<p>With just a couple of building blocks we can build reasonably private dApps.</p>
<p>Some other building blocks I'd like to see (not a complete list):</p>
<ul>
<li>Reputation (maybe through Ethereum ENS)</li>
<li>Identity (maybe on Polkadot or Ethereum ENS) for easier</li>
<li>Blob app integration (add xxDK chat to Crust app, or run Haven + Crust in the same browser tab)</li>
</ul>

<p>xx Network has its native currency XX coin, assets and NFTs. Unfortunately, XX is referred to as a "token" (not a currency).</p>
<p>Most of the Polkadot SDK-based chains promote NFTs, but I find assets also useful for some use cases.</p>

<p>It checks balance on an address in Polkadot.js wallet and depending on that value it allows you to access the site. Multiple "tiers" can be defined, of course.</p>

<p>All right! I think this should work for other addresses (not just the owner), but I don't know if any of these owners have sent them to other people.</p>
<p>Hey, that issuance amount of <code>test</code> looks weird - how come there's 100000000000 of 'em when the screenshot says 100?</p>
<p>The reason is assets may have different properties. We can RTFM or try the "create asset" workflow to see what goes in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="xx Network asset create options" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-11-05-xx-chain-asset-gated-access-02-fb7088a04f4946acf4b9db515c6b513d.png" width="1078" height="573" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>So, it appears <code>Intelligence</code> is an integer-based asset, while <code>test</code> has a crapload of decimals.</p>
<p>That's good to know, but it doesn't matter much to us in this particular workflow: we don't need to know how to look up an asset's properties as we usually accept one or more known assets.</p>
<p>If you're interested in that, however, find it <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/storage/#assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> - it's <code>api.query.assets.metadata</code> (in JavaScript). Polkadot.js API details related to assets can be found in <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/blob/9becdced121977a22c81df4d037c9d0e60b370a5/packages/types/src/interfaces/assets/definitions.ts#L1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repo</a>.</p>
<p>In JS I managed to do this:</p>

<p>OTC to the rescue! Create and publish <a href="https://haven.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haven</a> Space address for your OTC store and sell assets there. It sucks, but it can be automated. How?</p>
<p>You can build a bot - I once created a crude one - that reads comments in your channel and sells this stuff.</p>

<p>If something fails, Haven keeps data for 21 days so there's enough time to chit-chat in another Space (for human-powered support) where refunds and other issues can be dealt with.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are some edge cases I haven't thought of, but there's no reason why this can't work and there must be some detailed production-worthy examples in other ecosystems.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's move on. As Teddy KGB said, "Pay him... Pay that man his fxxxing money". Or send the man his freaking asset:</p>

<p>Yes, there are more problems...</p>
<p>Next month that guy will still have his 1 Intelligence. But we need to charge him again. What can we do?</p>
<p>Normally we'd use "Smart Contracts", but we can't (or at least I don't know how to do that on xx chain), so we have to come up with workarounds such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for a new token (Intelligence-Jan, Intelligence-Feb) every month (you can pre-release, and not sell, 12 of them at once), or</li>
<li>Sell 12 month subscriptions and issue a new asset every year , or</li>
<li>Buy back tokens at a tiny fraction of the original price, or</li>
<li>Check date of last pay the wallet did as well as the balance (complicated)</li>

<p>Few wallets have good reputation, but there are folks out there who could probably charge for monthly subscription.</p>
<ul>
<li>Newsletter (say, monthly validator analysis for stakers/nominators)</li>
<li>xx chain-related reports (nominator pays 10xx for staking payouts and Web reports/stats, for example)</li>
<li>Discord bots for asset-gated access to special channels</li>
<li>Private training/consulting (for Haven admins and users, e.g. 1 unit of an asset buys you 1 minute)</li>
<li>Classic "soulbound" assets given away for free (no OTC trading necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed Haven instance hosting sounds like another possibility, but that idea sucks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires absolute trust</li>
<li>Users who access such instances immediately identify themselves by their wallet ID (and xx is not a privacy coin) and maybe IP address, browser fingerprint and more</li>
</ul>

<p>xx Chain NFTs are covered in this <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/12/07/nfts-on-xx-network">post here</a>.</p>
<p>The xx Network Wallet has NFTs in the UI, but there's no way to issue them from the wallet without using the API (from the wallet, or directly).</p>
<p>You can find the NFT Pallet documentation <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nft-pallets#nfts-pallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, just mind the fact that xx Network Wallet won't let owners see them unless the wallet itself gets some upgrades.</p>

<p>As we've seen assets exist, and they can be used in ways similar to NFTs. NFTs are also available, but not in the Web UI.</p>

<p>The xx Network community hasn't done much to monetize Web (or should I say "Web3", to highlight my "DeFi" prowess) access.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is surely a lack of examples and documentation, and another is xx Network isn't big so developers tend to use assets and NFTs on more popular chains.</p>
<p>With XX coin-gated, asset- and NFT-gated apps, that is now easy to do and as I've mentioned above there are services that can be monetized on the cheap now that examples are available.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Today I <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forked and published</a> a comparison of various messengers. Why?</p>
<p>Because as the author of the original comparison can't possibly include everything (he actually checks and compares all those details, which requires non-trivial efforts) and he focuses on major messengers so Haven't currently isn't included. (He welcomes requests, so you could suggest Haven - Haven't (pun intended).)</p>
<p>Not having a mobile version probably doesn't help.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="wait-i-cant-run-haven-on-mobile">Wait, I can't run Haven on mobile?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#wait-i-cant-run-haven-on-mobile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wait, I can't run Haven on mobile?" title="Direct link to Wait, I can't run Haven on mobile?">​</a></h3>
<p>As of today, yes. I mean, you <em>can</em> run Haven on mobile Android and Linux devices with WASM-capable browsers, but the UI isn't responsive and it doesn't attempt to save battery, so it won't be pretty.</p>
<p>xx Messenger was a mobile app that would probably have done well in a comparison, but it used an older xxDK and is no longer maintained.</p>
<p>Haven is the main reference application for xx Network confidential &amp; private messaging. There's a patch for responsive UI which was delivered as part of Hacktoberfest 2024 activities, but it hasn't been merged yet. Keep an eye on that in coming weeks - if merged, that would make Haven more suitable - although just the UI - for Android browsers with WASM support.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the main topic, which is I wanted to create a post with some notes regarding the Haven column in that comparison page.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="notes">Notes<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notes" title="Direct link to Notes">​</a></h2>
<p>These are notes that clarify some of the values I picked for the Haven column in that comparison chart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="notification-if-contacts-fingerprint-changes">Notification if contact's fingerprint changes<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#notification-if-contacts-fingerprint-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notification if contact's fingerprint changes" title="Direct link to Notification if contact's fingerprint changes">​</a></h3>
<p>Most people have tried Signal. If you swap your phone or such, your Signal chat counterparts will be informed that your "fingerprint" changed. There's no such thing on cMixx (and in Haven).</p>
<p>Haven <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/haven-user-guide/identity">identity</a> <em>is</em> the only user-facing cryptographic identity.</p>
<p>You can't ""change" a fingerprint or anything like that. If you lose access to your identity (forget the password to encrypted identity file, or lose the identity file), you must assume a different identity. In that case there's no mechanism for you to rejoin a private Space (1-on-1 or group chat) and message contacts saying "this identity replaces this other identity". Who can tell if that's the same person?</p>
<p>If you have backups of the invite links and pass phrases you can rejoin those spaces using the new identity. But there's no way for others to know if the new identity is owned by the same person.</p>
<p>The only way to do this is to use the old identity to message everyone "from now on, I'll be using this new identity".</p>
<p>Another way is to use an <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/haven-user-guide/identity_external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external identity service</a> where people can look up identities you claim on xx Network. But that assumes they know your external identity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="findadd-contacts">Find/add contacts<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#findadd-contacts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Find/add contacts" title="Direct link to Find/add contacts">​</a></h3>
<p>See the previous point - there's no name service in Haven, so you can't "find" anyone.</p>
<p>You can use external identity services mentioned just above.</p>
<p>xx Messenger <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/idCollisionAndNotifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had this custom IDs</a>, but Haven does not. Personally I don't miss those - I think external ID services are the way to go because messenger contacts are just one of many things you need to have an address book for.</p>
<p>Since Haven is one of few messengers that is anchored in a blockchain, knowing someone's cMixx name is not enough. We want their wallet addresses (probably not just for xx coin, but for several currencies), their ENS name, and other public Web3 data they choose to publish.</p>
<p>Why you can't "add" contacts either? Well, we'd need to sync them somewhere. xx Messenger could upload (backup) its data to S3, so contacts could be saved as well.</p>
<p>xx Haven currently doesn't do that so contacts must be searched in external services where people publish their Haven identities. That location is a matter of choice as well - not just in terms of usability, but also privacy, cost, and more. Having to publish your data on ENS (and pay that fee) may or may not be liked by all users which is why I think Haven should leave those integrations to other cMixx messengers when they appear. I don't mind looking it up in whatever way is convenient for me and my contacts.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="supported-push-notification-services">Supported push notification services<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#supported-push-notification-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Supported push notification services" title="Direct link to Supported push notification services">​</a></h3>
<p>xx Messenger used a centralized push service, but Haven doesn't currently doesn't have it which means it's limited to constant polling which is power-consuming.</p>
<p>That doesn't matter much for desktops (there's more "unnecessary" activity from <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/coverTraffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cover Traffic</a> than from notifications), but matters on mobile devices.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="legal-jurisdication">Legal jurisdication<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#legal-jurisdication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal jurisdication" title="Direct link to Legal jurisdication">​</a></h3>
<p>The xx Foundation is a non-profit in the USA.</p>
<p>Mixnet round scheduling is done by the Foundation and that server is - if I'm not mistaken - in located the EU. The scheduling node isn't involved in data handling.</p>
<p>Client-side ecrypted user data has five copies per each cMixx round and so user data from each conversation lives in dozens of jurisdications (see <a href="https://dashboad.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cMix dashboard</a>). The scheduling server doesn't know which messages went into which mixnet round - only the sender and recepient(s) do, so those not included in a conversation wouldn't even know where encrypted data is.</p>
<p>Encrypted data is kept on cMixx gateways for 21 days after which only local (cached) copies may remain on participants' clients.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/11/01/haven-comparison-notes#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I obviously don't speak for the author of the original document, so the values I picked for Haven are my own.</p>
<p>This post elaborates on all the rows where I felt felt sharing some notes would be helpful. If the original author reviews and adds Haven to his document, I may or may not update my fork (I wouldn't if I completely disagreed with this evaluation, for example).</p>
<p>I have some other comparisons in other blog entries - you can search the site for "comparison" to find them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacktoberfest 2024</a> is over so here's what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added search function, keywords and front matter to 67 pages on <a href="https://learn.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://learn.xx.network/</a>. Usability, SEO, etc.</li>
<li>Repurposed existing sample code for Kusama to create <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/polkadot-js-tokengated-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token-gated site for xx coins</a> which can help anyone who wants to build toke-gated sites. Note that this works only for xx coin, but assets aka NFTs on xx chain would need additional work as asset (NFT) lookups are more complicated.</li>
<li>Published two simple PoCs for Haven-Tribler integration<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>one runs Haven in a Tribler chat frame (I tagged it "v1.0") - more secure, but less convenient (as always...)</li>
<li>another runs Tribler in a Haven iFrame ("v2.0")</li>
<li>both can be found <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-tribler-haven?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and there's a <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler">blog post</a> about the motivation, use cases and approaches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Published a toy extension for Firefox - see the Tribler-with-Haven blog post for more, and a screenshot is below.</li>
<li>Updated User and Admin guides to <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/docs/category/xx-network-haven-users-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network Haven</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the "common good" contributions (xx Network Learn, etc), the rest was centered around exploring Haven integrations with Tribler.</p>
<p>This screenshot sums it all up - Tribler in Haven iFrame (aka my "v2.0") - and the toy Firefox extension in action!</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a Magnet link in a Haven space</li>

<p>Let's see about the whys first: you need to find torrents that you want to download.</p>
<p>Tribler has internal search feature but it's not that good yet.</p>
<p>So you go out on the Web to find torrents, which means one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being tracked on Torrent search Web sites</li>
<li>Monetary (and sometimes privacy) cost of subscribing to VPN service</li>
<li>Using Tor to hide your activity</li>
<li>Registering at Torrent sharing private Web sites or chats</li>
<li>Using some password-protected site where you're registered with a fake or real identity</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a better way? I think there is: one UI with Haven and Tribler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone posts RSS feed into a private (or public) Haven Space ("chat channel")</li>
<li>Users copy links and download them using Tribler</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, Haven could run inside of Tribler. But the Tribler project would have to make that happen. Alternatively, someone could create and maintain a patch. Not very good.</p>
<p>Another way is to create a small patch to Tribler menus and run Haven in an iFrame.</p>
<p>Another way is to run Tribler in a Haven iFrame. That's easier, but you have to create a small patch for Haven, which some privacy-sensitive people may not like.</p>

<p>A Haven iFrame in Tribler chat menu is available <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-tribler-haven/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I call this attempt v1.0.</p>
<p>You click on the chat cloud icion and Haven opens in the main pane (iFrame).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Tribler with a Haven iFrame" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/tribler-with-haven-iframe-50fa42fec60a59cda3a52ce625ba3dbd.png" width="931" height="360" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: join a Haven Space ("chat channel")</li>
<li>Step 2: find a magnet link</li>
<li>Step 3: paste it into "Add torrent"</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in</li>
</ul>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time the user navigates away from the chat menu, Haven state is lost and user cannot access Haven again without logging in</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see what I mean? If your use case is "get into a Haven Space, get one link, copy it to Tribler and leave Haven", this is actually a good approach. All it takes to secure access to Haven is to navigate away: you won't leave Haven iFrame open because in order to use that Magnet link you'll have to leave it. Just make sure your Haven profile password is strong!</p>
<p>Note that this only hides your Haven identity, Spaces, and chat data, while Tribler UI is still running and downloaded data is on disk.</p>
<p>The second approach I tried - a Tribler iFrame in Haven - works the other way around, except there's no state in Tribler (it's a server-based application with a Web UI) so if you download multiple torrents or like to chat with Space members as you download, this may be better for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Haven with a Tribler iFrame" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/haven-with-tribler-iframe-c8ad47f0ddb017cf455472d09dd1c2fd.png" width="1544" height="654" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Join a channel, get your links, download them in Tribler and watch/manage downloads as they go.</p>
<p>In this approach there's a small patch to Haven which seems low-risk to me if you're the only user of your Haven instance: you own the Haven instance and you own the Tribler instance as well, so as long as you're not concerned about Tribler in a Haven iFrame, I think patching Haven and using it this way is fine.</p>
<p>I'm working on finalizing these small patches in another release at the same location as v1.0.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="do-we-actually-need-any-integration">Do we actually need any integration?<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler#do-we-actually-need-any-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do we actually need any integration?" title="Direct link to Do we actually need any integration?">​</a></h3>
<p>That's a good question. If you don't use both of these applications at the same time often, it's probably best to use them separately and avoid complications.</p>
<p>As an example of yet other approaches, I've built a simple browser extension which downloads selected (Magnet) links using Tribler: very easy to use, no patches required. But you can't see or control what's going on with downloads without going to another tab or window with Tribler UI.</p>
<p>I couldn't load Haven in this "preview" version of Firefox (WASM issues), but this is how simple the extension is: select a Magnet link in Haven chat and use the extension to initiate Tribler download.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Download with Tribler Extension" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/haven-with-browser-extension-2d8b862c5e70c1b64e4d73c74ac38513.png" width="1317" height="757" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This can work anywhere including the "Haven with a Tribler iFrame" approach because it simply talks to the Tribler API and Tribler UI doesn't need to be visible. It saves some copy-and-paste even if Tribler runs in the same browser tab as Haven. I've posted a proof-of-concept version <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/magnet-link-downloader-tribler-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> - see the link for the details.</p>
<p>If you're a security freak, I won't try to persuade you to use these iFrame approaches.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="security-concerns">Security concerns<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/10/29/xx-haven-with-tribler#security-concerns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security concerns" title="Direct link to Security concerns">​</a></h2>
<p>It is possible that the app in iFrame does something to its parent frame. If you worry about that, of course just run the apps separately or even in different VMs.</p>
<p>In the "Haven with a Tribler iFrame" approach we could tighten the iFrame CORS, and also properly integrate applications so that we don't have to skip authentication from <code>localhost</code> clients on Tribler (which I currently do). I'll post the patches in the repo for easy reviewing. Risk of someone else accessing your instance of Tribler on <code>localhost</code> (where Haven is running) through Haven iFrame should be extremely low, though.</p>
<p>And this instance of Tribler should not listen on public IPs - simply close off its Web UI and IP ports.</p>
<p>If you want to let others access Haven on the same computer, you could simply start another container binding a public IP and port. The same goes for extra Tribler instances.</p>
<p>In a crazy mix-up setup you could run a "groupware edition" of Haven-Tribler compose.yaml:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haven-Tribler setup for multiple users (who all share same Tribler and can be in the same channel if they're all focused on same content)</li>
<li>One Web server gateway sharing static content (Tribler download directory) for authenticated downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>That would be as secure as the stupidest downloader.</p>

<p>Haven provides private and confidential access to Magnet links that can be used in Tribler: free access, post-quantum E2EE, and metadata shredding eliminate the need to use Tor, VPNs or privacy-leaking Web sites.</p>
<p>Among DIY approaches at lightweight integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>For single-torrent and one-off use, Tribler with a Haven iFrame is a good approach which forces inconvenience (and results in good SecOps)</li>
<li>For parallel use (Haven + Tribler) and multiple downloads, I like Haven with a Tribler iFrame because it gives me full control over Tribler</li>
<li>For "hidden Tribler" we can run Haven + browser extension that hooks into the Tribler API, but you'd want extra controls and visibility into downloads, which means either occasional access to Tribler UI or a fat extension with some Tribler indicators similar to "Down Them All" or such (which is complex).</li>

<p>I added it to a fork <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/bip_utils_xx/commit/6b15ab0d26aa8a75238a1047336e82e1549c79bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You could make similar/same modifications to bip-utils and build it yourself, of course.</p>
<p>I'd have to submit a patch to upstream, but "generic" Substrate coins are supported as well, so you could use it the same way without "hardcoded" XX configuration in bip-utils. You'd need to specify a custom coin/chain configuration, though. In the fork, that's already done.</p>

<p>I haven't compared VPN-related features because xx Network doesn't offer that service. You may want to do your own comparison vs. Mullvad VPN or other VPN service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="blockchain">Blockchain<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blockchain" title="Direct link to Blockchain">​</a></h3>
<p>This isn't important for end users, but Polkadot (used by xx Network) has a bigger ecosystem compared to Cosmos.</p>
<p>Governance and integrations seem better on Polkadot and that's why it's been relatively easy for xx Network to create integrations (bridge) with Ripple and Ethereum, for example. I expect this will continue simply because xx Network leverages a superior blockchain platform (Polkadot).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="validators">Validators<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Validators" title="Direct link to Validators">​</a></h3>
<p>Nym is still running a permissioned network that's smaller than xx Network's. In this regard, they're behind.</p>
<p>Perhaps out of necessity, Nym has a more restricted entry and exit conditions for validators. I actually like how they do this and I think it's better than xx Network. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New validators can join via a NYM-to-NYX swap contract. The contract will not allow more than 1% of total stake increase per month to prevent sudden hostile takeovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The contract will only allow swapping NYM to NYX and will not allow exchanging NYX back to NYM. A NYX holder who wishes to sell their NYX stake will have to do so via OTC trades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may say this doesn't prevent indirect hoarding of coins, but at least at this moment (because the network is permissioned with KYC, it appears) they can control this better. xx Network has some small pools that should be banned from the network, but the problem probably isn't significant enough to motivate the community to move against it.</p>
<p>xx Network is permissionless as far as staking and identity are concerned. So, although Nym's rules and controls seem helpful, they may not be possible to implement on xx Network or a permissionless Nym network. We'll see how Nym adjusts to permissionless life (if they ever get there).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="services">Services<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Services" title="Direct link to Services">​</a></h3>
<p>Nym provides a Wireguard-based VPN routed over their network, which xx Network doesn't do.</p>
<p>While this seems great - you don't need to buy Mullvad or other VPN subscription, for example - it's a trap.</p>
<p>Not for the users, but for Nym Tech and their community whose nodes provide that service.</p>
<p>I don't think they'll be able to pull this off because bandwidth requirements will be huge and there's no way operators who operate VPN entry/exit nodes can do that with residential connections. What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means SPs or the cloud, and that means they'll need to be paid.</p>
<p>But, now you have KYC + getting paid for VPN + risk of illegal use (which they can't really monitor because it's encrypted and censorship-free). Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>Do you want to make $500/mo and deal with daily DMCA notices and maybe even police inquiries? Not many people do, unless they're based in a 3rd world country.</p>
<p>I don't know how they're going to pull that off. If I was them I'd allow only whitelisted destinations, but for most of those people don't really need to use VPNs.</p>
<p>We'll see. I'm skeptical.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="integrations">Integrations<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#integrations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrations" title="Direct link to Integrations">​</a></h3>
<p>I haven't done a deep dive on these, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nym is ahead in VPN-related integrations simply because there's not much to integrate and xx Network doesn't have that integration to begin with</li>
<li>Mixnet integrations are hard to compare because they're dissimilar and each platform has a few so maybe it's fair to say it's roughly even</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Network has wallet integrations through Proxxy (cMix-backed API proxy), while Nym's own wallet natively uses Nym's mixnet (and they have Zk-nyms), so in wallet integrations they're likely better.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="payments">Payments<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#payments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Payments" title="Direct link to Payments">​</a></h3>
<p>xx Network doesn't have blockchain privacy features. This decision was deliberate - I wrote about it <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/04/11/sec-targets-uniswap-total-ban-in-view">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nym has zk-nyms which makes it a privacy-capable coin and therefore a candidate for delisting (or harder listing) on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>If you need a VPN, you can get Mullvad VPN and pay with Monero. If you're a Nym VPN user, then it appears you can buy Nym VPN credits with Zcash.</p>
<p>Both approaches work, but with Nym you can buy both VPN and pay for mixnet services with one coin. Now you may say "I prefer Monero and Mullvad", but that's a matter of preference and convenience.</p>
<p>xx coin, the native currency of xx chain, may add privacy features in the future but it's been de-prioritized to avoid regulatory and listing challenges.</p>
<p>One valid point in Nym's material is that you can acquire their coin and pay for services without being tracked. xx Network can't do that. At the same time, xx Network cMix service is still free, so there's nothing to pay for. You still <em>don't need</em> any xx coin to use xx Network in the first place!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="mixnet">Mixnet<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#mixnet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mixnet" title="Direct link to Mixnet">​</a></h3>
<p>First, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a to-do item for Nym, and implemented in xx Network's cMix.</p>
<p>Second, Nym's network is still centralized, so every single validator is known. Said differently: Nym mixing is decentralized, but all the mixers are known.</p>
<p>Third, in their <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litepaper</a>, they have a comparison between cMix (mixnet used by xx Network) and their modified 3rd party design (based on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-piotrowska.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loopix</a>). I'm not qualified to evaluate that, so I won't.</p>
<p>And then there's this thing below. As a reminder: their litepaper was published (updated?) in 2023, so it's not like they've missed anything because it didn't exist in mid 2023.</p>
<p>In the table below they refer to Elixxir (which was the company behind xx Network/cMix early on) although xx Network has become foundation-managed years ago and Elixxir no long plays a role. Maybe using a prehistoric name is a way to say "we created that in 2019 and forgot to update". Well, you didn't and your litepaper was published on Nov 2, 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-08-20-nym-vs-cmix-883252249a85e0a74143c500e753cffb.png" width="685" height="448" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Let's see:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 - Incentivised relays</strong> - xx Network has had that for years. Validators stake themselves and get staked by other coin holders. They get rewarded for authoring blocks on xx chain and relaying cMix messages. <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage/">In coming quarters</a> postage for premium tier users.</li>
<li><strong>2 - Scalable network</strong> - xx Network has almost 400 nodes - more than enough for its traffic needs - and it doesn't seem not scalable (or whatever is the opposite from scalable). For a mixnet focused on short messages (whether it's text messages or API calls), it seems scalable enough to me.</li>
<li><strong>3 - Secure and efficient encryption protocol</strong> - As I've mentioned earlier Nym claims their approach has a higher efficiency which I am unable to judge, but they don't have post-quantum encryption so even it it's more efficient, is it more secure across the board? It's a blanket statement. Not to mention that xx Network's cMix was developed in-house by Dr. Chaum and is still being developed (this includes development for <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage">three Worldcoin grants</a>), while Nym's is a modified implementation of a 3rd party invention.</li>
<li><strong>4 - Community governance of the relay nodes</strong> - xx Network has had this for years and Polkadot has better governance features than Cosmos.</li>
<li><strong>5 - Large anonymity set</strong> - xx Network currently uses 5 nodes and most messages generally delivered within 3 seconds (see Real Time (round) component in the <a href="https://dashboard.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network dashboard</a> - mean 24h latency is currently 2.12s). That seems enough for the use cases targeted by xx Network (chat, API proxy, voting, etc.), and can be increased. I don't know how large (it's not in the litepaper and I didn't try very hard to find that information elsewhere) Nym's anonymity sets are, so this advantage isn't quantified and doesn't appear significant for xx Network use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Nym has some advantages, but they're behind in terms of development - fully permissioned chain, no PQC and with legal challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>VPNs are cool, but it's also just bulk traffic - porn, Torrents and crap of that nature. Not that we don't need that too, but it's a saturated and legally sensitive market (copyright violations, illegal content, etc). Due to the high cost of comparatively enormous bandwidth required for VPNs, it will be a very tough use case to monetize. And Nym Tech has bills to pay.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaum's decisions to not create a privacy coin and to focus on specific (and high-value) use cases such as messaging and voting were in hindsight perfect. The choice of blockchain platform (Polkadot/Substrate) - whether due to luck or wisdom or a combination of both - also seems better than Nym's Cosmos, so I expect less hurdles and faster progress with xx Network's Web3 integrations.</p>
<p>Personally I'm comfortable with design choices, target markets and other details of xx Network.</p>
<p>Nym looks like a decent platform, but they've made some less than ideal choices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> this is not investment advice. I've no idea what will happen and I don't recommend anything.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>xx Network has been around for years and has users, but not very many because:</p>
<ul>
<li>many Web3 and coin projects suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome (<a href="http://localhost:3000/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>)</li>
<li>many projects don't know about xx Network</li>
<li>several smart projects know and appreciate xx Network but they're are still in the process of integrating with xx Network (or the other way around)</li>
</ul>
<p>Worldcoin is one of those smart projects in "the other way around" situation - xx Network is creating integrations for Worldcoin and this is work in progress (and progressing well).</p>
<p>Specifically, there are three Worldcoin Foundation grants that were awarded to xx Network-affiliated developers. You can read or listen about it in this interesting interview with <a href="https://patcrypt.com/worldcoin-xx-network-collaboration-interview-with-mario-yaksetig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the developers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Worldcoin is doing their thing. Today I saw <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-mimos-partnership-bring-digital-proof-humanness-malaysia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MIMOS Berhad, the applied research and development arm of the Malaysian Government, has signed an MoU with the Worldcoin Foundation, Tools for Humanity (TFH) and MyEG, a leading e-government services provider, to integrate Worldcoin technology into the country’s digital infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The intent of the MoU is to leverage the Worldcoin protocol and TFH technologies to improve ongoing and future work related to digital credentials. In doing so, it validates the importance of digital proof of humanness in the age of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, wait, how many people live in Malaysia? 34 million.</p>
<p>Whoa - xx coin will go to the moon!!!</p>
<p>No, it won't. But fine - let's talk about postage!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="postage">Postage<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postage" title="Direct link to Postage">​</a></h2>
<p>I've blogged about "postage", which is how xx Network plans to charge for its Premium tier suitable for power users.</p>
<p>Where will the collected postage go? Mostly to the validators - server operators on xx Network - and (if I recall correctly) part of it goes to the xx Foundation.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the price of xx coin will moon? Of course not.</p>
<p>We don't know if those Worldcoin apps in Malaysia will actually be released. It's just an MoU.</p>
<p>Even if they make it, we don't know if they'll <em>choose</em> to use Worldcoin's privacy features that rely on xx Network. The Malaysian integrators <em>could</em> choose to not use them at all and I'd say this may be the most likely outcome in this particular country.</p>
<p>We don't know how many apps will be developed, and how frequently they'll be used.</p>
<p>We also don't know if the apps will <em>need</em> access to Premium tier. Each individual user probably won't need it and postage measures access by each individual user. An app can have 5 million users and as long as each sends or receives several messages per minute, none of them will need to pay postage.</p>
<p>Are the chances of Worldcoin apps using xx Network's Premium tier nil, then?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="why-pay-postage">Why pay postage<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#why-pay-postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why pay postage" title="Direct link to Why pay postage">​</a></h2>
<p>While only a very small percentage of Worldcoin (or other platform's) users will require access to Premium (or "unlimited" aka "best effort") tier, anyone who charges for their application or service or wants to prevent <em>another</em> paying user (or all the free users) from hogging them out, may want to ask users to subscribe to the Premium tier if it's affordable enough.</p>
<p>I'm not making this up to spread the idea that massive demand for xx coin is inevitable or just around the corner.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is I expect postage will be inexpensive enough to be purchased for "just in case" situations.</p>
<p>When you think about it, that's almost the opposite from "xx coin will moon" - the idea here isn't to create scarcity and get rich off the appreciating xx coin. On the contrary!</p>
<p>The way markets work is: if you want more of something, you pay for it just enough to make the seller willing to satisfy that demand.</p>
<p>If xx Network's message mixing service (cMix) works well for you, there's no "reason" to pay anything. (But you have the option to donate to the Foundation if so inclined).</p>
<p>But the presence of a Free Tier also means that everyone gets the same rights.</p>
<p>Someone can stand up 500 containers in AWS and spam the network all day long just because. Or simply try to freeload as much as possible.</p>
<p>If this happens at scale, quality of service as experienced by Free tier users may be impacted.</p>
<p>If you are getting paid for the app you sell or rely on xx Network at scale, then it may be wise to avoid such congestions where a busy day for Free tier users translates into a busy day for your Support staff. It's better to pay some postage just in case of accidental or malicious congestions.</p>
<p>As users pay for Postage, decentralized nodes that participate on the network ("validators") earn more xx coins which means more nodes can come online without diluting any node's daily earnings and at the same time improves network throughput.</p>
<p>Demand for xx coin may result in its price going up, but I would not expect significant impacts from demand for postage because as long as <em>similar</em> services exist, no one will pay 3x premium for xx Network. They may pay a 10% or even 110% more, but not for very long.</p>
<p>In addition to this "just in case I need it" scenario, there may be high volume users who prefer to use Premium tier on a regular basis.</p>
<p>A power user who sends thousands of messages every day (example: IoT feed or remote camera that chunks images into many "text" messages) could set up multiple identities to stay within the Free tier limit, or make his life simpler and pay a small premium for 1-2 thousand messages above the cut-off message limit for the Premium tier.</p>
<p>How will postage work? You may view a draft of high-level design for v1.0 features <a href="https://patcrypt.com/plans-for-postage-v1-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see in that document, users will also be throttled per smaller units of time, so that no one can overload the network by exhausting their daily quota within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>We can also see that in v1.0 there will be no "reserved capacity" which some users would probably like to have. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elections: with 5 million voters and (only) 3 hours to vote, you may want to prepay for 600 messages per second during voting hours on the election day. xx Network would then lower its Free tier throughput from (let's say) 7 to 5 messages per client per minute and drop total Free tier throughput per second by 600 messages per second. But this isn't easy. We may need smart contracts (to reserve time) which Polkadot SDK has, but xx Network hasn't yet activated on its Substrate-based xx chain. And there's another problem: speculators could front-run legitimate buyers as election dates are known in advance and often hard-coded in legislative acts</li>
<li>Any user with "guaranteed minimum" requirements. Even if you need to send just 1 message per minute (which well within the Free tier - there's 1,440 minutes in a day) - you may want to pay postage in order to able to send at least one message per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>When you consider all these niche scenarios, it's easy to see how this gets complicated quickly. I've no idea what's the best way to go about it in Postage v2 or later, but for thousands of users with custom requirements, Smart Contracts maybe the way to go as all mixing nodes can easily look them up on xx chain.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="node-operators-and-permissionless-postage">Node operators and permissionless postage<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#node-operators-and-permissionless-postage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Node operators and permissionless postage" title="Direct link to Node operators and permissionless postage">​</a></h2>
<p>If you need guaranteed throughput for your clients, you can strike a deal whereby an operator gives you a dedicated, guaranteed fraction of their node's connections. You'd have to approach them on xx Network Discord and so on, but in theory that's possible.</p>
<p>No one needs to know, you get guaranteed throughput when everyone else may be timing out while connecting to xx Network gateways. Can that be done?</p>
<p>Not for very many messages and users, but it's certainly viable for either Free or Premium tiers. I can reserve 10kB/s for your client IP or throttle everyone else but your IP, for example.</p>
<p>Any node operator could make such side deals on their own for users <em>who don't mind to always connect to the same gateways</em>. That decreases user's privacy, so that's a trade-off which may or may not matter.</p>
<p>Another trade-off is if the network is overloaded, that node may be able to accept your messages just fine, but still unable to complete mixing them with other (random) groups of nodes out there, so it's not guaranteed to work in terms of actually sending messages.</p>
<p>I conclude this would be possible but not very valuable for either the node operators ("validators") or users. The Premium Tier is expected to be cheap enough to make these laborious workarounds unnecessary and unattractive financially, technically, and privacy-wise.</p>
<p>One use case for this may be local elections, where the government stands up 3-4 nodes and limits access to in-country IPs. As noted above that would impact - maybe even compromise (I'm not qualified to tell) - privacy, but not the integrity of messages (protected by PQC), but it would also make DDoS attacks on that day much harder to execute - any in-country IP addresses could be shut down in minutes, while foreign IP addresses wouldn't be allowed to connect to those gateway nodes. I can't estimate the impact of this approach so I wouldn't recommend it, but there may be similar use cases where having your own node on the network could be beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#final-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final thoughts" title="Direct link to Final thoughts">​</a></h2>
<p>I don't expect Worldcoin's integrations in Malaysia will result in much demand on xx Network <em>when</em> postage becomes available. For Malaysia, I wouldn't be surprised if the government mandated that all Worldcoin-integrated apps include various gov-mandated data gathering add-ons.</p>
<p>But what excites me is that similar integrations will sooner or later happen in some other country. A Worldcoin-integrating app developer <em>may</em> also choose to enable xxNetwork-related privacy features. If that sounds unlikely to you, please see the interview with Mario and the voting integration (one of the three grants). Even Malaysia may want to enable anonymity in a Worldcoin voting app and disable it in other domestic Worldcoin applications.</p>
<p>Postage v1.0 may not be able to satisfy all use cases right away. DoS-style attacks by sock-puppet accounts could cause issues even to users of the Premium tier, but xx Network has world-class developers who are no doubt aware of all these things and will make recommendations related to privacy, security, performance and reliability expectations.</p>
<p>Postage v1.0 may become available a few months from now and it is one of the features essential for monetization of xx Network's mixing services.</p>
<p>Other apps rely on donations, subscriptions, or may be VC-backed and don't need to charge just yet.</p>
<p>xx Network is integrated with a blockchain service and very unique in that regard. Rewards - and later postage - are sent and received on a blockchain. For messaging, servers that pass and mix messages are operated by individuals from many countries and they're currently rewarded for their "mixing", but there's only a free tier so rewards aren't as impactful and demand for coins is lower because there aren't real life use cases for it. Postage will improve and better align users' and operators' incentives.</p>
<p>My take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worldcoin in Malaysia won't make xx coin "go to the moon"</li>
<li>Benefits of xx Network integrations with Worldcoin are real. Potential for adoption is real. When the first integrated implementation happens xx Network traffic could see a significant increase</li>
<li>All other apps that use xx Network as "transport" could use Premium tier, but currently Worldcoin seems to be the most significant integration.</li>
<li>Postage won't make xx Network expensive to use. It will make xx Network deliver more value</li>
<li>Until there's a way to <em>reserve</em> throughput, apps with high reliability expectations should have a way to fallback to Tor or direct access when uptime is more precious than privacy</li>

<p>I'm not a cryptography expert, so all I can do is rehash information from trusted sources (and you may verify it if you wish).</p>
<p>What value does rehashing content that I myself can't verify add? Usually not much (so I don't do it) but:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one improves discoverability</li>
<li>It curates some information that I find valuable</li>
<li>It can't post this where I should, so I am blogging about it here</li>

<p>So the news - to me - is that xx Network client switched to CTIDH. I didn't know that until today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[xx Network client] switched to CTIDH after a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vulnerability</a> was found for SIDH. Users interested in PQ messaging should use this branch.</p>

<p>Where can people find easy-to-digest information about CTIDH? Go <a href="https://ctidh.isogeny.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>What cryptographic primitives does xx Network client use? Current list from <a href="https://git.xx.network/elixxir/docs/-/commits/master/end_to_end.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the edited page</a> that still mentions SIDH s:</p>
<ul>
<li>XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.</li>
<li>Blake2b: Length is 256 bits. Used as part of key generation, key expansion, identity generation, and identification codes. Used to combine Diffie–Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.</li>
<li>HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.</li>
<li>Diffie–Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the page still mentions SIDH for PQ and below that is a note that it was replaced by CTIDH is below it. This is so that if you have a client with an older build, you know that you should use a newer client if you care about latest PQ encryption.</p>

<p>They didn't.</p>
<p>xx Network picked SIDH at the time it was <em>not</em> known to be vulnerable and they did it because it was evaluated and found to be suitable.</p>
<p>One reason particularly stands out to me because it alone - given that SIDH used to be recommended by experts in the field - made it very desirable for use in PQ private messaging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the primary reason is the key sizes as they fit into a single packet</p>

<p>As you can see the SIDH vulnerability paper was published <em>after</em> xx Messenger was released.</p>

<p>It came out early and it used xx Network in a way that's not efficient by current xx Network standards (now the recommended way is <a href="https://git.xx.network/elixxir/xxdk-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xxDK</a>).</p>
<p>As direction of development changed towards a less generic, more Web3-oriented applications, xx Messenger wasn't updated, but it was still considered not at risk and it wasn't promoted either. It would have needed total overhaul (front-end for Web3, back-end for xxDK) and while the source code is still available, the application itself was pulled (or allowed to expire, I'm not sure) on iOS. I haven't checked for Android.</p>

<p>I've said at the top that I can't post a simple comment on CTIDH update where I'd like to. I meant I'd like to visit techlore.tech and share an update.</p>
<p>I'll use this post to say a few words about that community of independent thinkers.</p>
<p>Last February I head over there, register and, in a topic related to Wickr alternatives, mention <strong>two</strong> applications that use xx Network's cMix (not just xx Messenger):</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakeasy/Haven - as a modern (xxDK mentioned above) version but not yet for mobile</li>
<li>xx Messenger - as a mobile app that (at the time) was still available on iOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I'm following xx Network closely, I <em>know</em> that xx Messenger isn't maintained, I know <em>why</em> (for the reasons explained above), so I mention that Phoenixx.io plans to launch a modern mobile messenger and that Speakeasy may also become available for mobile.</p>
<p>But, in one comment I make a mistake and cite that false statement by the Signal CEO and also say that Signal <em>has</em> metadata that has been disclosed to law enforcement and assist in identifying users (not the content of Signal messages). A minor mistake - which I admitted and rephrased - was that I said that Signal had in the past disclosed users' IP addresses, but of course they wouldn't do that as law enforcement comes to them asking about the use of Signal (they likely already have users' IP address). I stick to the statement that metadata had been disclosed and that IP addresses <em>could</em> be as well.</p>
<p>Members and the owner respond with dismissive comments, insults, accusations and foul language.</p>
<p>Guy nicknamed TechFounder <a href="https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=site%3adiscuss.techlore.tech+%22xx+network%22&amp;d=4678435270362092&amp;mkt=en-WW&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=CQQ_JiUp0zhPgYEILFIgyomLftTED_lL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes first</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where’s their Post-Quantum encryption documentation? Has it been auditied (sic!)/proven it actually protects against those attacks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gee, indeed, where could it be possibly found? Maybe by searching the Internet for 'xx Network' or 'xx Messenger'?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You didn’t provide anything useful for anyone, just for your ego saying that your obscure messenger it’s better than Signal when it clearly isn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that's what triggered them: I pointed out that the big news about Signal being the first with PQ was really a piece of fake news since xx Messenger (and possibly other) PQ messengers have been out there for a while. I did <em>not</em> claim xx Messenger was better at all.</p>
<p>She didn't say Signal was the first <em>major</em> PQ messenger and it wasn't on X/Twitter - her statement was posted on Mastodon - so she wasn't limited by the maximum number of characters per post so that she couldn't qualify her statement. To me, that's a problem and simply pointing that out ought to be useful to the community because it says something about the person who runs that shop. Not that she's compromised or anything that bad, but if you can't trust 100% of what a person says, it may be the time to start scrutinizing every word that comes out of their mouth.</p>
<p>One may say it's an innocent mistake despite not being limited by word count on X - one word less or more, what's the big deal? She's not a semi-literate, misspelling computer geek familiar with only computer languages. She <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker#Early_life_and_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knows better</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whittaker completed her bachelor's <strong>degree in rhetoric</strong> at University of California, Berkeley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or maybe she was indeed precise and accurately stated that Signal was the first to add PQ encryption to Signal. xx Network was the first to add it to xx Messenger. Everyone is right!!!</p>
<p>And what about TechFounder's obscurity comment? Of course, what can possibly be more obscure to people actively engaged in cryptography and privacy than work of Dr. Chaum?</p>
<p>But not everyone at Techlore.tech is incompetent and dismissive. Another user - Karner - obviously performed due diligence. Their expert opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re referring to an obscure blockchain-based scam-based messaging platform that has no users and uses a broken cryptosystem (SIDH)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right, I'm promoting scams which I guess makes me a scammer (or a useful idiot at best). That's a promising line of attack against my claim that xx Messenger was PQ before Signal!</p>
<p>Never mind that I didn't even mention xx coin. But now that I am blogging on my personal blog everyone can check my X posts (tweets) and blog posts here and easily find dozens of occurrences where I encouraged and invited people to "invest" in xx coin and all the claims it's going to moon. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Also never mind that although SIDH - one of the pieces in that stack - was found to be vulnerable, xx developers estimated cMix was still fine.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://discuss./t/wickr-messaging-is-no-longer-available-as-of-31-12-2023/6576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThiccRaiden</a> (claims to accept any pronouns in his/her/their profile - must be very nice, I thought) says to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You join the forum, literally make shit up and then backpedal to ‘well it’s hypothetically possible,’ while promoting a random messaging app</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The stuff I "made up" was the IP misstatement mentioned earlier, which I rephrased and which didn't impact the validity of my claim about Signal's access to that metadata - they may not <em>retain</em> it, but they do have it, as does AWS.)</p>
<p>I respond to ThiccRaiden's rude message by saying that I don't care about the rudeness, but I won't respond in kind and if the site owner moderates, they should apply the same rules to all members.</p>
<p>By now I've been called a scammer, poster of useless information (spammer?), and liar. What a hearty, warm welcome!</p>
<p>The site owner completely ignores all that and doubles down on ThiccRaiden's message of ignorance and FUD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Android App hasn’t been updated since August of 2022. Not touching this with a 50ft pole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's unpack that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is obscure</strong>. False. It wasn't a Tier 1 - let's say it wasn't even Tier 2 - messaging application, but that doesn't matter. It was very likely the first PQ messenger, by early 2024 it was out there with PQ for years before other "alternatives to Wickr", cMix that it uses was created by some of the top people in the field and we know it wasn't obscure because the app had many downloads. Not only are/were there cMix messaging apps in ongoing development, but application interfaces are being implemented for "application messages" from other projects as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saying that Signal has users' identifiable metadata is "making shit up"</strong>. Is that true? Yes. Signal operates Signal gateways. We know they have at least some MD on (date of user's last use).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may have seen this slide which says that Signal can provide "last date of a user's connectivity to the service".</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Signal and user metadata" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-7c494b2cfddc58255c520bbd6084ff2b.png" width="1431" height="635" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saying that it's hypothetically possible is back-pedalling</strong>. It's not just "hypothetically" possible, it's simply "pending a search warrant". It's not even Signal that owns Signal gateway nodes - it's the freaking AWS!</li>
</ul>
<p>If law enforcement delivers a search warrant to Signal, Signal gives what they have and law enforcement finds you used Signal yesterday. Then they also find that among 15 suspected friends of yours only one has also used Signal yesterday - how hard is it to guess which of the 15 may be the guy you used Signal to communicate with?</p>
<p>If Signal retains only "date" (no hour, no second), could AWS be asked to provide their firewall logs to help LE narrow that down a bit? Yes, but only theoretically, so don't worry about it!</p>
<p>Oh, no, they in fact do provide more than just a "date". Oops!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Signal metadata in response to search warrant" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-signal-metadata-response-to-search-warrant-183fcac74c9a0a5887be2286702b96f2.png" width="638" height="249" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>Millisecond precision. That's <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from here</a>.</p>
<p>How about this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>LE asks Signal for a timestamp and gets it with millisecond precision</li>
<li>LE asks AWS to give list of IPs accessing Signal gateways through AWS firewall during a 200 millisecond interval surrounding the timestamp provided by Signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that only theoretical? How many IP addresses would AWS return? 50? How many from a small country? I'd say just one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger hasn't been touched in a year</strong>. I know that, I know why, and that's why in my original message I said that and also gave links for Speakeasy/Haven and the Phoenixx app (at the time called Echoexx and available for alpha testing). But why not ignore all that and make a completely biased and ignorant comment (not that I care, but they purportedly do, being big on education and stuff).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is vulnerable</strong> (I don't have the exact wording). When I mentioned xx Network's PQ encryption, they laser-focused on trashing xx Network because of SIDH and completely ignored that I showed that the Signal CEO in fact lied when she said they came up with PQ first, and that SIDH was not vulnerable when xx Messenger adopted it. Now that SIDH has been replaced CTIDH, I wanted to reflect on that thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xx Messenger is a scam</strong>. This is hilarious. xx Messenger wasn't a blockchain-based app, it couldn't connect to any blockchain whatsoever, and even to this day xx Network's cMix is free for use. You don't need any coins, I even <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important">blogged about that here</a>. But there's also a subtler, Signal-related point that I want to make at the bottom of this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of their comments are still online:</p>

<p>Nice people, right? Well, <a href="https://www.techlore.tech/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they say this about themselves</a>:</p>

<p>When you see "don't make shit up" in response to your civil and on-point comment, you know you're being educated!</p>
<p>It's a trap!</p>

<p>This is the owner's comment that followed (in which he didn't even comment on what I said about the unnecessarily abusive language in several earlier comments):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Warm welcome by Henry Fischer" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-06-06-techlore-admin-01-006e7ea2d59a0258e921458fd075fd01.png" width="752" height="566" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>His vision (also from the About page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We envision a world where technology works for us, not against us—and we want to prove to people they can make a real impact for themselves and others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's very funny because I just recalled that, <em>after</em> the abuse that followed my comment on xx Network applications as possible alternatives to Wickr, I spent three hours creating (in the appropriate section) a post with xx Network resources, and answering questions from members who were interested in it. Making an impact, contributing, discussing with other knowledge-thirsty individuals, helping your fellow men better themselves - that's what it's all about, right?</p>
<p>And where's that topic?</p>
<p>Oh, it's nowhere!</p>
<p>They simply deleted my account, responses from the Wickr thread and all the content I'd created (even from the other generic topic), so it's all gone now. They also wiped my xx Network topic from archive.org. "We care a lot!"</p>
<p>Since only the quoted parts of my messages survive and they deleted all my responses while leaving their own comments and attacks online, I think it's perfectly appropriate to post about my Techlore experience here where they can't censor and delete me.</p>

<p>Only ever make positive comments about Signal and don't double-down on them if you want to last.</p>
<p>That's my "lesson learned" from the short and miserable experience I had on that site.</p>
<p>I just checked on archive.org and found that penguin_terminal echoed my thoughts in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231205214557/https://discuss.techlore.tech/t/signal-usernames-are-finally-coming/6069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> comment made in 2023:</p>

<p>I didn't think of this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your ISP reports you to the authorizes when logs show you accessing servers used by Signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once your friendly government offices gets the "date" from Signal, they can ask the local telco or ISP for the hour, time and millisecond. Not that Signal already doesn't give that, but getting it locally is easier and they can get your phone number or fixed line subscription details in the same go. Nice!</p>
<p>Like me, he got "corrected" another Signal fan, Tech-Tropper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely theoretical and wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh? Why? Here's why Session sucks (according to Tech-Tropper):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, Session does not have PERFECT SECRECY. Just take your recovery code and login in with another device. You will see the messages sent in the last week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's simple - they "just take your recovery code". Scientists estimate that 94% of Session users have their recovery code on a yellow Post-it note on the side of their refrigerator.</p>
<p>One last thing about that Wickr thread and techlore.tech I want to say is about that "not touching this with a 50ft pole" by the site owner. Does this make any sense to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy kept using Signal without PQ encryption (simply because Signal <strong>did not have any</strong>) for years. He presumably still uses it, despite Signal having his phone number, responds to warrants, while both Signal and AWS have access to his metadata</li>
<li>But xx Messenger is a disaster because SIDH was found to be vulnerable. Never mind that there's no evidence that the app was exploited or even exploitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what's wrong with people on that site and I won't speculate about it.</p>
<p>I'm just happy that they deleted my account before I wasted too much time there.</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on that scam accusation and the parallels with Signal, as I said I'd do at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>On Techlore forums they justify Signal's "need" for phone numbers as the only way to prevent spam.</p>
<p>Ugh, okay, but that's a "in order to save the village, we had to destroy it" kind of measure for a <em>privacy</em>-related application!</p>
<p>xx Network is still <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/04/06/i-like-wrapped-xx-coin#why-its-important">completely free and will introduce API limiting only for power users and only when postage becomes available</a>, you don't need a phone number <em>and</em> you can use a network-native, decentralized identity. This has worked this way since 2022. Phoenixx also implements ENS-related identity (ENS).</p>
<p>xx Network is open to spam, that's true. If it was spammed, postage would probably be implemented sooner. But if you don't know a person's xx Network identity (which you can't unless they give it to you), there's no way to spam them in the first place so spam is still not a problem.</p>
<p>If you now consider just the privacy aspect here: which of these is a bigger honeypot and potential (privacy) scam here?</p>
<p>One app has your phone number and some metadata.</p>
<p>The other doesn't know anything about you, its gateways are decentralized in dozens of jurisdictions, there's nowhere to "register" your data and there's no plan for the average user to ever needing to pay anything.</p>
<p>I don't think either of the platforms is a "scam", but it's easy to see which one is designed for privacy and why having a coin users don't ever have to buy beats collecting phone numbers.</p>
<p>One of them is a major honeypot, that's for sure.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="how-to-include-xx-network-chat-in-your-application">How to include xx Network chat in your application<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat#how-to-include-xx-network-chat-in-your-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to include xx Network chat in your application" title="Direct link to How to include xx Network chat in your application">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a very simple test or "proof of concept", if you will, for the inclusion of xx Network chat in Web applications.</p>
<p>To minimize the amount of work required, I used <code>iframe</code>s:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top frame shows a Web-based ImpressJS presentation</li>
<li>The bottom frame shows xx Network Haven (formerly Speakeasy) app - event organizer is showing his view of a channel while using the community instance at <a href="https://haven.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://haven.xx.network</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://armchairancap.github.io/assets/images/2024-05-17-01-iframe-chat-for-presentations-04cc190386b0a31034351ab708d55e42.png" width="1050" height="535" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>The chat participants don't login to Haven in this Web browser.</p>
<p>The bottom frame only shows chat from event participants, but both the top and bottom frame are just for viewing of organizer's content.</p>
<p>Any chat comment would be entered by each chat participant in their own xx Haven session (maybe another browser altogether).</p>
<p>Can guests comment and how?</p>
<p>The event organizer <em>may</em> share the invitation link and password in order to allow participants to comment from own Haven instance (accessed in the participant's browser), but that is optional.</p>
<p>We have several possible scenarios. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the event owner can chat (answer voice questions, share links...)</li>
<li>Event owner and event guests (panelists, for example) chat, while guests can only view their comments in that <code>iframe</code> above</li>
<li>If event guests are provided with the channel invite, they can login to xx Haven (own or public instance) and chat (ask questions, comment, etc.) as well</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="what-works-and-what-doesnt">What works and what doesn't<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/05/17/speakeasy-haven-private-event-chat#what-works-and-what-doesnt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What works and what doesn't" title="Direct link to What works and what doesn't">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a very basic, no-code PoC, so it's not surprising that it's not usable in this form.</p>
<p>Production-worthy setup would require some customization of at least xx Haven CSS, if not the application itself.</p>
<p>But even so, we can appreciate and highlight some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>No email or other identity needs to be shared with the organizer, but panelists or viewers <em>may</em> choose to identify themselves by providing a signed proof of external identity</li>
<li>Guests/panelists and possibly viewers receive the link - maybe it's shared in the presentation, maybe in another xx Haven channel - but links are not personalized and we can't know who is the author of each comment</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events open to public comments may be abused by spammers. Although individual accounts can be blocked by channel admin, automated spam attacks would be laborious to deal with so fully open events may be hard to manage</li>
<li>Layout: obviously the xx Haven frame doesn't use space economically. We'd have to create an instance that only exposes the chat itself, and possibly put that "chat box" in a narrow, vertical frame to the right</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Network currently retains messages for three weeks which may be both good and bad depending on use case.</p>

<p>While this "integration" isn't even an integration - it's just two <code>iframe</code>s - I think it does show the opportunity for using xx Network for events in which the identity of each chat participant can remain hidden and any comments cannot be linked to them even by the event organizer.</p>
<p>This runs contrary to the approach taken by most marketing-focused events - in the sense that participants' privacy <em>decreases</em> engagement and tracking - but for events where privacy of the commenter is important, there's no way to link a participant's IP address with comments.</p>
<p>A participant's IP address could be hidden by accessing the Web event address over Tor, but comments may be entered directly in participant's own instance of xx Haven which can even be running locally (e.g. in container).</p>
<p>Furthermore, xx Haven provides unique, reusable identities (bossCompartmentalisedDisownment in the first screenshot), so each network identity can be reused without disclosing the participant's IP address and/or true identity. This may be useful in situations where a participant wishes to be recognized - for example, a designated identity may be reused across events to provide support or engage in 1-on-1 chat with participants for follow up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[SecureDrop tries to reinvent the wheel instead of integrating decentralized messengers]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1589835968911413249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I've said it already</a> so I'll just rephrase: it takes three PhDs to use SecureDrop - one admin, one journalist and one user.</p>
<p>But you don't know what you don't know, so instead of fixing the complicated mess that (current) SecureDrop is - which could be done by including <strong>any</strong> viable open source decentralized messenger into their packaged solution - they're coming up with <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new protocol</a> of their own. Of course.</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is implemented here is a small-scale, self-contained, anonymous message box, where anonymous parties (sources) can contact and receive replies from trusted parties (journalists).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where's the server?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server: For this project, a server might be a physical dedicated server housed in a trusted location, a physical server in an untrusted location, or a virtual server in a trusted or untrusted context. Besides the initial setup, all the connections to the server have to happen though the Tor Hidden Service Protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fine, I'll just set up my own Hidden Service.</p>
<p>But, does Source need a PhD?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Source(s): No on-device persistence shall be required for a source to interact with the system; they should be able to conduct all communications using only a single, theoretically-memorizable passphrase. The source uses Tor Browser to preserve their anonymity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just using Tor Browser properly is very hard. Haven users don't need to use Tor, but they may if they wish. Because with Haven, Tor is optional so it's much harder to use Tor incorrectly if either party does choose to use it for secure direct messaging.</p>
<p>I'd even say that modern messaging apps like xx Network's Haven almost <em>cannot</em> be used incorrectly. Choose a strong password and don't have a spyware infested browser or OS. That's basically it.</p>
<p>But this is SecureDrop, so here we go again... Start by subscribing to Udemy's "Python from Zero to Hero"...</p>

<p>In this approach Source shares files over a Tor Hidden Service and informs a Journalist to download the file.</p>
<p>This doesn't require <em>any</em> development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journalist publishes their Haven nick (e.g. MrTriggerHappyJourno)</li>
<li>Source runs owns <a href="https://github.com/armchairancap/xx-haven-container" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haven container</a> or accesses other party's (e.g. public) Haven instance to create their own identity (DrDeepThroat)</li>
<li>Source initiates chat with Journalist using Haven by contacting them directly and inviting them to personal chat channel with DrDeepThroat and MrTriggerHappyJourno as the only participants</li>
<li>If the Source decides to share their files, they start Onion container with Hidden (Web) Service and share the link to the Journalist in Haven private chat</li>
</ul>
<p>I provide a walk-through and sample configuration files below.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="push-method">Push method<a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/blog/2024/05/08/can-securedrop-reinvent-the-wheel-probably-not#push-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push method" title="Direct link to Push method">​</a></h3>
<p>This approach follows SecureDrop's approach where the "file upload" site is operated by Journalist. That seems like a very risky idea to me - Sources would better off uploading files to one of decentralized S3 services - but that's how SecureDrop does it.</p>
<p>In this approach they would still use a decentralized secure messenger (Haven from xx Network or some other) and the same Web server app Secure Drop already has.</p>

<p>I think it's easier to use Haven and Pull method than SecureDrop (Push method) and I'll show you why.</p>
<p>With Docker installed, the Source downloads this repository from Tor Browser or over SOCKS5 proxy (using git cli) and starts all the services they'll need.</p>

<p>Haven is now running on localhost (temporary VM) and Caddy provides HTTPS proxy at <a href="https://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://localhost:443</a> to Source. This takes care of secure messaging and metadata shredding.</p>

<p>This list below shows all services in this Docker Compose.</p>
<p>The configuration files can be in line with best practices and thereby require <strong>zero configuration</strong> by either Source (they use Haven and Web server) or Journalist (they use own instance of Haven).</p>
<ul>
<li>Caddy - HTTPS proxy for Haven</li>
<li>NGINX - Web server that runs my Tor Hidden (Web) Service</li>
<li>Haven - local (personal) instance of Haven (to create Haven identity and chat with Journalist)</li>
<li>Alpine/Tor - Tor server that exposes Hidden (Web) Service at a <code>.onion</code> address</li>

<p>Actually, <code>index.html</code> isn't even necessary - it's there to make this demo simpler - by being able to view index.html which links to file.txt.</p>
<p>In any case, our Source shares 6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion with his Journalist and that's it.</p>

<p>With Tor identity removed, next time the Sources wishes to use the same stack they have a new Onion address while Haven identity could be restored if they backed it up (by exporting it from Haven Web UI to JSON file) and stored in a secure location.</p>
<p>Back to those file names: our Source could share a direct link to the file (6x366z3rjmkx4ebtlpbq2hyoqng2yzy46zjtivydo4xovfj5xbk7zuid.onion/file.txt) and file.txt could be encrypted if you wanted the extra security - the Source may share that password with the Journalist in their private Haven chat channel.</p>
<p>The password could be shared with the Journalist in Haven, but if the file is randomly named there's no risk of anyone guessing this file name on a Hidden Service address with directory listing disabled (it is disabled by default on NGINX).</p>

<p>SecureDrop wants to reinvent their own wheel despite the fact that there are several good decentralized, secure messengers.</p>
<p>Normally, secure drops start with secure messaging and they'd be better off if they simply picked one of existing options.</p>
<p>Once that's taken care of, file upload/download is no longer difficult when done on Onion network.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say these are "solved problems", but the point here isn't that xx Network's Haven "solved" the problem of secure messaging (maybe it did, maybe it didn't - <a href="https://xx.network/whitepapers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see for yourself</a>). It is that SecureDrop very likely can't solve it <em>better</em> than other decentralized messengers.</p>
<p>They ought to stop dreaming about their own "protocol" and do what they're supposed to do which is making it easy to share files in private.</p>]]></content:encoded>
