<p>The Altcoin Daily <a href="https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1867719193577324947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a pumping &quot;suggestion&quot; about the top quantum-computing resistant coins for 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>CELL</li>
<li>OZO</li>
<li>QRL</li>
</ul>
<p>What does that even mean? Nothing, really.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a low-effort post (maybe even an AI-generated shitpost) meant to gain followers and have the shills post their nonsense comments.</p>
<p>They post a the top three symbols from CMC&#x27;s list of PQ coins with highest market capitalization, and then those who are involved in PQ-related projects need to explain to &quot;investors&quot; which of them is &quot;the best&quot; and why:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Top CoinMarketCap PQ coins in December 2024" src="/assets/images/2024-04-14-cmc-top-pq-coins-58a4dcdb6fdc41a6b1d9824ab9a082d4.png" width="929" height="587" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>And in Altcoin Daily&#x27;s post CELL is listed a the top - in alphabetical order - but QRL is listed before OZO, which may be due to OZO paying less or nothing for that post.</p>
<p>But still, what does this mean?</p>
<p>Every few days I hear some speculator asking how xx Network compares to this or that coin, why xx Network isn&#x27;t &quot;pumping&quot;, and such.</p>
<p>Everyone should read and answer for themselves, but I admin I haven&#x27;t done it as well because I thought most of it is nonsense and a waste of time. Fundamentally, privacy means inconvenience and extra cost (in time or hardware or software), so privacy-focused solutions are not easy to sell.</p>
<p>But now this is a topic that we are expected to have an opinion about, so let&#x27;s take a look at what these projects are, their claims, are and <em>whether</em> they should be compared with xx Network (and if so, how).</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="cellframe-cell">Cellframe (CELL)<a href="#cellframe-cell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cellframe (CELL)" title="Direct link to Cellframe (CELL)">​</a></h2>
<p>From their <a href="https://cellframe.net/white-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By design, Cellframe’s architecture is a structure with a dual-layer sharding. The first layer (heterogeneous layer) can launch customizable subchains and tokens. On the second layer (homogeneous layer), subchains are organized in Cells. Due to interoperability features we plan to build an ecosystem of services where every app (or dapp) will have an opportunity to exchange information with another app in a p2p manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is nice, but as always, I don&#x27;t like this rebuilding of the wheel.</p>
<p>Everyone has a dApp platform... Including xx Chain (and all Substrate-based chains). Even Polkadot - a top coin - doesn&#x27;t have enough apps (and their ecosystem has <strong>hundreds</strong>), and can&#x27;t sustain a stablecoin because there&#x27;s not enough liquidity compared to &quot;the top dogs&quot;. What are the chances these guys can make it?</p>
<p>Or take this example from the sme white paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main idea of Cellframe is multiple subchains, containing Plasma (any blockchain element) inside of syngeneic Cells (shards).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this sound like Polkadot&#x27;s parachains (which xx Netowrk could adopt and use)? Does</p>
<p>And from the <a href="https://cellframe.net/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap page</a>, here&#x27;s what is <em>yet to be done</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release of mechanism for stakers to delegate keys to validators using Cellframe Dashboard (xx Chain has Simple Staking, adopted from the Polkadot ecosytem)</li>
<li>EVM-compatible service (xx Chain could adopt it from Polkadot ecosystem)</li>
<li>They&#x27;re developing own format of interchangeable tokens (besed on the numbers, such as CF-20, it&#x27;s similar to Ethereum&#x27;s)</li>

<p>As you can see the main <a href="https://cellframe.net/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> I have with Cellframe is they are reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Examples from two recent releases, 5.3-327 and 5.3-277:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue with serialization/deserialization of data in JSON-RPC</li>
<li>Fork auto-resolution mechanism</li>
<li>Functionality of the <code>tx_history-addr</code> command</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what happens when you decide to build the wheel from scratch. Ongoing and yet-to-be discovered security and other problems.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re META or Ethereum, maybe you can pull it off. If you&#x27;re not, well...</p>
<p>Interestingly Cellframe runs a <a href="https://kelvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPN</a>, with the following pricing:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="CELL VPN - KELVPN" src="/assets/images/2024-04-14-cell-vpn-pricing-7e3a19c035265925e2f632f6c4b37304.png" width="706" height="639" class="img_xHFY"></p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="/blog/2024/08/20/nym-vs-xxnetwork">Nym</a> and the risks I mentioned there (read it to get the idea, if you don&#x27;t already have it)...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Cellframe and KelVPN are products from the same parent company, “Demlabs,” KelVPN is a separate project with a dedicated developer team. KelVPN is the first service built on Cellframe, which is a blockchain platform for different decentralized services. KelVPN is based on the Cellframe parachain and uses Cellframe SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a comparison, search this blog for &quot;postage&quot; or take a look at <a href="/blog/2024/08/16/worldcoin-xx-postage#introduction">this post</a>: xx Network is a DAO and plans to provide paid mixnet servics in what I think is a much better way (no &quot;parent company&quot; and associated risks, crypto-only payments with XX coin obtained from a DEX or CEX).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cellframe.net/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQs</a> gives the following examples of services that could run on Cellframe:</p>
<ul>
<li>decentralized VPNs and CDNs</li>
<li>messengers and social networks</li>
<li>voting</li>
</ul>
<p>Messaging has worked on xx Network for years and is the focus of the network. Voting has also undergone a lot of research (see <a href="https://votexx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Votexx</a>) and implemented for <a href="https://worldcoin.org/wave0-grant-recipients/votexx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldcoin</a>.</p>
<p>It appears some Cellframe services (or &quot;ideas&quot; of services) overlap with Nym&#x27;s, others with other projects (e.g. StorJ for CNDs), and some with xx Network (except that xx Network has had them for a while and are xx Network&#x27;s main focus).</p>
<p>PQ-wise, Cellframe uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon. I haven&#x27;t looked into these yet.</p>

<p>It reminds me of Nym, but with some Ethereum features (basically nothing that one can&#x27;t do on PolkadotSDK chains).</p>
<p>While some use cases seem similar to xx Network&#x27;s, they don&#x27;t really have those apps because they&#x27;ve been busy rebuilding the wheel.</p>

<p>QRL has been around for a long time (longer than xx Network, six years vs three for xx Network), and has a decent following.</p>
<p>QRL&#x27;s mission is a PQ chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide enterprise grade security to the blockchain space with the future quantum threat in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what they have at CMC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is a &#x27;fully quantum resistant blockchain network, using PQ-CRYPTO recommended/IETF standardized cryptography&#x27;. The QRL utilizes a hash-based eXtended Merkle Tree Signature Scheme (XMSS) instead of ECDSA, which is reportedly vulnerable to quantum attacks and found in many other blockchain projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#x27;s that about ECDSA? Well, <a href="https://fullcirclesecurity.org/2024/11/26/nist-announces-the-end-of-rsa-and-ecdsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST</a> announced its depreciation:</p>

<p>OMG, we&#x27;re screwed!!!</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current draft</a> of this deprecation plan says (as of 2024/12/14):</p>

<p>Up to 11 years to go, and that&#x27;s <strong>if</strong> you depend on ECDSA and must use it. xx Chain <em>does not have to</em> use ECDSA signatures.</p>

</blockquote></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theqrl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web site</a> says the their chain uses XMSS, a NIST-approved post-quantum secure digital signature scheme.</p>
<p>Similarly to Ozone Chain (below), they use lattice-key storage.</p>
<p>QRL uses <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RandomX</a>, a proof of work (PoW) algorithm based on random code execution.</p>
<p>They claim two audits, by red4sec and x41 D-sec, which is very nice but also expensive. As I recall xx Network had one audit, in 2021, for example.</p>
<p>They have post-quantum addresses developed in-house, which xx Network also has (Sleeve, mentioned further below in the xx Network section).</p>
<p>In terms of plans, here&#x27;s what they have on their site on next generation of QRL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>codenamed Zond, is introducing key features such as web3 compatibility and a proof-of-stake protocol with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract support. QRL Zond integrates post-quantum secure methods with Ethereum architecture, offering a secure platform for future applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EVM support is nice and PolkadotSDK chains can also run EVM in addition to its own native ecosystem with hundreds of applications, but that is not the focus of xx Network (cMixx is).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="opinion-on-qrl">Opinion on QRL<a href="#opinion-on-qrl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Opinion on QRL" title="Direct link to Opinion on QRL">​</a></h3>
<p>With its focus on chain and wallets, QRL is a &quot;PQ-Litecoin&quot;, if you will. Monero is also a PoW chain, I don&#x27;t see that QRL focuses on privacy, so I changed that to &quot;PQ-Litecoin&quot;.</p>
<p>Having Sleeve-like wallet generator and two audits is very helpful for coin-based use cases.</p>
<p>xx Network is a messaging forcused PQ project. Wallets (created with Sleeve) are PQ-secure and the chain itself is very likely going to become PQ-secure because Polkadot DAO is very well funded with a vibrant ecosystem (if you don&#x27;t understand the value of PolkadotSDK to xx Chain, <a href="/blog/2024/11/25/xx-network-and-polkadot-ecosystem">see this post</a>).</p>
<p>To summarize: QRL has some advantages over xx Chain, but they may not be sustainable. On the other hand, it has no meaningful applications except the coin itself, while xx Network focuses on PQ-mixnet services.</p>

<p>Ozone&#x27;s QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests. That&#x27;s nice.</p>
<p>Ozone claims three PQ-related features:</p>
<ul>
<li>QRNG - quantum process-based random number generator</li>
<li>QKD - quantum key distribution</li>
<li>PQC - post-quantum cryptography that uses lattice-based cryptography (whichis different from cMixx, for example). Resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure how QKD works and why they need it. It&#x27;s a <a href="https://ozonechain.io/validator-node/#a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secret</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Setup quantum tunnels between your node and other nodes
Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, so is this a permissioned network as far as validation is concerned? Let&#x27;s see (on the same page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new validator will be accepted by the network after a period of 6 hours mentioned by epochlength in the genesis file is passed and if it received the votes from a majority (above 50%) of existing validators within the 6 hours period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears to be permissioned because you can&#x27;t become a candidate without the developers&#x27; help and once you do become a candidate, there&#x27;s no market mechanism (such as NPoS on Substrate-based chains including xx Chain). NPoS isn&#x27;t perfect, but this one is ... mysterious. You need to get permitted, and then lobby the existing validators to join in. That&#x27;s strange, and maybe more &quot;centralizing&quot; than NPoS.</p>
<p>Also on the same page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>Setup quantum tunnels between your node and the newly created nodes
Contact ozonechain developers in its official discord channel for node admins.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If Discord is down, you can&#x27;t become a validator.</p>
<p>About PQC in Ozone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CRYSTALS-Kyber. CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) comprises two lattice-based cryptographic primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kyber, a CCA-secure KEM, and</li>
<li>Dilithium, a strongly EUF-CMA secure digital signature algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#x27;t comparable to xx Chain (see other comments about PolkadotSDK-based chains), which don&#x27;t claim PQC, and <strong>users</strong> of xx Network&#x27;s cMixx mixnet aren&#x27;t directly impacted by lack of chain-level PQC.</p>

<p>Ozone&#x27;s QRNG sounds like snake oil to me. You can read about it <a href="https://whitepaper.ozonechain.io/quantum-random-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The reason I say that is the illustration implies custom hardware, so unless everyone has one, these random numbers may be emitted from a centralized source (&quot;Ozone Foundation&quot; or some 3rd party <a href="https://random.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beacon</a>?).

When it becomes necessary xx Chain will likely use a PQ DVRF such as Drand Bridge Pallet (if it&#x27;s PQ or after it becomes PQ).</p></div></div>
<p>Ozone is EVM compatible and has half a dozen apps (DEX, memes, games) - all unrelated to what xx Network does.</p>
<p>My take: it&#x27;s a PQ EVM platform on a small EVM-compatible chain. There are dozens of EVM-compatible chains that are larger and permissionless.</p>
<p>Ozone&#x27;s transactions are currently around 4,000/day, while xx Chain has around 600 and many of them are nomination/validation-related, so it has to be said that xx Chain has very few transactions. Why is that?</p>
<p>The action on xx Network hapens on cMixx (mixnet), which is free to use and doesn&#x27;t require any coins (XX or other). On the other hand, many of Ozone&#x27;s transactions may be DEX and memecoin traffic.</p>
<p>Block times are 5 and 6 seconds, respectively, but in the case of xx Chain that&#x27;s not realy pertinent to almost any relevant use case (as I&#x27;ve mentioned, the action is happening on cMixx).</p>

<p>Ozone&#x27;s PQ-related features look nice, but it&#x27;s a tiny platform where you may be PQ-ready, but can be excluded or banned at any time. The threat of that is probably higher than the threat of CRQC...</p>

<p>This is the same thing as QANON... sorry, QANX: Ethereum with PQ patches.</p>
<p>xx Network isn&#x27;t in PQ EVM or blockchain business, so there&#x27;s noth much to compare, but aside from that, they don&#x27;t have anything in place: it seems they&#x27;re trying to ICO now, so they may be a year from a functioning decentralized mainnet, and even then they won&#x27;t have anything similar to cMixx.</p>
<p>I commented <a href="https://x.com/armchairancap/status/1868500204464546272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="other-coins-in-the-x-thread">Other coins in the X thread<a href="#other-coins-in-the-x-thread" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other coins in the X thread" title="Direct link to Other coins in the X thread">​</a></h3>
<p>I saw a bunch of coins/chains mentioned in the thread. I checked five, and three of them were random shitposts pumping loser coins that have nothing in terms of PQ readiness.</p>
<p>Two I&#x27;ve heard of, and was able to find something PQ-related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorand (ALGO) - partially ready (uses FALCON), but VRF <a href="https://algorand.co/technology/post-quantum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is vulnerable</a> and will have to be swapped out (same as PolkadotSDK-based chains). No sign of PQ in wallets (addresses), though.</li>
<li>Hedera (HDR) - doesn&#x27;t seem ready in any way. <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/post-quantum-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This post</a> explains that. No signs of any PQ features.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, they&#x27;re very &quot;L1-focused&quot; (similar to the three coins higlighted by Altcoin Daily). Algorand&#x27;s addresses and signatures may be in trouble and Hedera&#x27;s probably, too.</p>
<p>In any case, they don&#x27;t appear focused on PQ messaging, so who cares.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-network-xx">xx Network (XX)<a href="#xx-network-xx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx Network (XX)" title="Direct link to xx Network (XX)">​</a></h2>
<p>First, each stack of xx Network should be separately analyzed. I&#x27;m not a cryptographer,</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-chain-xx-token">xx Chain (xx token)<a href="#xx-chain-xx-token" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx Chain (xx token)" title="Direct link to xx Chain (xx token)">​</a></h3>
<p>XX is the native token of xx chain.</p>
<p>xx Chain is a Substrate- (or, PolkadotSDK-based) chain which is PQ-ready. Whazzit mean?</p>
<p>It means that once PolkadotSDK <em>is</em> PQ-ready, xx Chain will be updated to be ready as well.</p>
<p>Does that means all PolkadotSDK chains will be PQ-ready? Not really.</p>
<p>xx Validators - and all who used <a href="https://sleeve.xx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleeve</a> have PQ-ready wallet addresses and PQ-ready wallet pass phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleeve ... derives the quantum-secure wallet, which is not currently used, but will be necessary in the future in order to rollover existing non quantum secure wallets into quantum secure wallets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleeve uses WOTS+ and has a defined path to upgrade the chain to support WOTS+ signatures in transactions and user accounts. From <a href="https://github.com/xxfoundation/sleeve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uses a WOTS+ key as the underlying quantum secure key. After the WOTS+ key is generated, we save the quantum secure public key (PK). This public key will be used as the Wallet address when full quantum secure capabilities are implemented in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sooo.... xx Network is in a very good place.</p>
<p>Do these other PQ coins have such wallets? As far as I can tell, QRL may have it. Those who don&#x27;t won&#x27;t become ready without migrating existing wallets.</p>
<p>Any non-PQ ready chains <strong>as well as</strong> PQ-ready without PQ addresses will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually move all assets to a new quantum secure wallet (address)</li>
<li>migrate blockchain signature system to WOTS+ (or similar)</li>
</ul>
<p>xx Chain wallets with Sleeve-generated wallets won&#x27;t need to do any of this.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="cmixx">cMixx<a href="#cmixx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cMixx" title="Direct link to cMixx">​</a></h3>
<p>The real PQ action - and why xx Network probably shouldn&#x27;t be compared with those coins - is in cMixx.</p>
<p>cMixx employs the following <a href="https://learn.xx.network/cmixx/design-specs/end_to_end" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptographic primitives</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>XChaCha20: Length is 256 bits. Used for encrypting message payloads.</li>
<li>Blake2b: Length is 256 bits. Used as part of key generation, key expansion, identity generation, and identification codes. Used to combine Diffie–Helman and SIDH keys after key integration.</li>
<li>HMAC-SHA256: Length is 256 bits. Message HMACs.</li>
<li>Diffie–Hellmen: Length is 3072 bits. Discrete log-based component of key negotiation.</li>
<li>SIDH: Length of public key is 3024 bits. Quantum resistant component of key negotiation in theoriginal cMix. In <strong>cMixx</strong> (current implementation) SIDH was replaced by CSIDH.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="xx-network-development">xx Network development<a href="#xx-network-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to xx Network development" title="Direct link to xx Network development">​</a></h3>
<p>I don&#x27;t speak for xx Network, but based on what&#x27;s happening now and what I think will happen in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>xx Chain is PQ-ready and will adopt PQ enhancements from PolkadotSDK which will surely come about. Some enhancements (such as provable decentralized randomness) are already available, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not necessary</li>
<li>cMixx is the core service of xx Network and what sets it apart from these three coins. There are integrations for mixing wallet transactions (e.g. with Metamask), private and confidential ID lookups (Worldcoin) and Haven, a reference messaging platform. You can look at the current grants (on forum.xx.network) and see all of them are related to improving cMixx. One of</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#x27;t maintain this comparison, but see <a href="https://armchairancap.github.io/xx-network-haven-comparison/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how Haven (and cMixx in general) compares against other encrypted messengers.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_U9DT" id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final thoughts" title="Direct link to Final thoughts">​</a></h2>
<p>The Altcoin Daily post is meaningless. But obviously &quot;it worked&quot; because it made me spend time on writing this post.</p>
<p>While all three coins (CELL, OZO, QRL) have PQ-ready chains, from what I can see not all have PQ addresses.</p>
<p>Some have heavily centralized validation while others are backed by commercial entities (and therefore centralized). These factors present greater risks than CRQC.</p>
<p>None of them <strong>focus</strong> on messaging. Cellframe mentions it as a use case, but that&#x27;s far from having anything usable and in production.</p>
<p>xx Network&#x27;s blockchain is already sufficiently PQ-resistant, and given Polkadot DAO&#x27;s resources, will be ready before it becomes important. xx Network addresses generated with Sleeve are considered secure.</p>
<p>xx Network&#x27;s main service, cMixx, is also PQ-resistant. It&#x27;s been in production for years (try <a href="https://haven.xx.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xx Network Haven here</a>), and has integrations unrelated to XX coin. In fact cMixx mixnet can be used for mixing wallet RPC calls of any coin (see Proxxy) and it can be done for free.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to blockchain, xx Network has PQ and other features that rival those three projects: some xx Chain features are much better, and others can be added by integrating the currently unused components of PolkadotSDK.</p>
<p>In terms of PQ features of the chain itself, those chains may be ahead, but they are bogged down in re-developing the same chain features that have been developed elsewhere, with a fraction of Polkadot DAO&#x27;s resources that xx Network can use for free (and that&#x27;s not &quot;porting&quot; the way some of these coins do with Ethereum&#x27;s features, but the relatively simpler &quot;enabling&quot;).</p>
<p>Regarding chain features, the three coins are ahead of other chains out there, but their problem can be summarized like so: aside from address readiness (which two seem to have), will other coins out there reach PQ before these coins reach their own escape velocity?</p>
<p>xx Network shouldn&#x27;t be directly compared with them, but I think it&#x27;s better in both ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain-wise, some PQ features are less developed, some same or better (Sleeve). But xx Network&#x27;s non-PQ features are way ahead due to the use of PolkadotSDK and these cost relatively little to develop and advance</li>
<li>PQ services-wise, xx Network is focused on messaging and in that area ahead of all three. As for other services (unrelated to messaging mixnet), I think it&#x27;s better to not focus on many - one use case is hard enough - so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that cMixx can&#x27;t do phone calls, or transfer files</li>
</ul>
